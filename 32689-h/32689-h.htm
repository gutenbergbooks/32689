Dindigul has risen into importance as the centre of a trade in tobacco

large European cigar factories here. The town has manufactures oe silk,
muslim#and blankets, and an export trade in hides and cardamoms; and
there is a large native Christian population, with two churches. The
ancient fort, well preserved, stands on a rock rising 350 ft. above the
town; this was formerly a position of great strategic importance,
commanding passes into Madura from Coimbatore, and figured prominently
in the military operations of the Mahrattas in the 17th and 18th
centuries, and of Hyder Ali in 1755 seq., being thrice captured by the
British (1767, 1783, 1790). After the two first captures it was restored
to Hyder Ali under treaty; after the third it was ceded to the East
India Company.</p>

<p><span class="bold">KARL WILHELM DINDORF<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (1802-1883), German classical scholar, was born at
Leipzig on the 2nd of January 1802. From his earliest years he showed a
strong taste for classical studies, and after completing F. Invernizi&rsquo;s
edition of Aristophanes at an early age, and editing several grammarians
and rhetoricians, was in 1828 appointed extraordinary professor of
literary history in his native city. Disappointed at not obtaining the
ordinary professorship when it became vacant in 1833, he resigned his
post in the same year, and devoted himself entirely to study and
literary work. His attention had at first been chiefly given to
Athenaeus, whom he edited in 1827, and to the Greek dramatists, all of
whom he edited separately and combined in his <i>Poetae scenici Graeci</i>
(1830 and later editions). He also wrote a work on the metres of the
Greek dramatic poets, and compiled special lexicons to Aeschylus and
Sophocles. He edited Procopius for Niebuhr&rsquo;s <i>Corpus</i> of the Byzantine
writers, and between 1846 and 1851 brought out at Oxford an important
edition of Demosthenes; he also edited Lucian and Josephus for the Didot
classics. His last important editorial labour was his <i>Eusebius of
Caesarea</i> (1867-1871). Much of his attention was occupied by the
republication of Stephanus&rsquo;s <i>Thesaurus</i> (Paris, 1831-1865), chiefly
executed by him and his brother Ludwig, a work of prodigious labour and
utility. His reputation suffered somewhat through the imposture
practised upon him by the Greek Constantine Simonides, who succeeded in
deceiving him by a fabricated fragment of the Greek historian Uranius.
The book was printed, and a few copies had been circulated, when the
forgery was discovered, just in time to prevent its being given to the
world under the auspices of the university of Oxford. Shortly after the
death of his brother, he lost all his property and his library by rash
speculations. He died on the 1st of August 1883.</p>

<p>His brother <span class="sc">Ludwig</span> (1805-1871) was born at Leipzig on the
3rd of January 1805, and died there on the 6th of September 1871.
He never held any academical position, and led so secluded a
life that many doubted his existence, and declared that he was
a mere pseudonym. The important share which he took in the
edition of the <i>Thesaurus</i> is nevertheless authenticated by his
own signature to his contributions. He also published valuable
editions of Polybius, Dio Cassius and other Greek historians.</p>

<p><span class="bold">D&rsquo;INDY, PAUL-MARIE-THÃ‰ODORE-VINCENT<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1851-&emsp;&emsp;),
French musical composer, was born in Paris, on the 27th of March
1851. He studied composition and the organ at the Paris Conservatoire
under CÃ©sar Franck, and obtained the grand prize offered
by the city of Paris in 1885 with <i>Le Chant de la Cloche</i>, a dramatic
legend after Schiller. His principal works, beside the above, are
the symphonic trilogy <i>Wallenstein</i>, the symphonic works entitled
<i>Saugefleurie</i>, <i>La ForÃªt enchantÃ©e</i>, <i>Istar</i>, <i>Symphonie sur un air
montagnard franÃ§ais</i>; overture to <i>Anthony and Cleopatra</i>; <i>Ste
Marie Magdeleine</i>, a cantata; <i>Attendez-moi sous l&rsquo;orme</i>, a one-act
opera; <i>Fervaal</i>, a musical drama in three acts. Vincent d&rsquo;Indy
is perhaps the most prominent among the disciples of CÃ©sar
Franck. Imbued with very high aims, he was always guided by
a lofty ideal, and few musicians have attained so complete a
mastery over the art of instrumentation. His music, however,
lacks simplicity, and can never become popular in the widest
sense. His opera <i>Fervaal</i>, which is styled &ldquo;action musicale&rdquo;, is
constructed upon the system of <i>Leit-motifs</i>. Its legendary
subject recalls both <i>Parsifal</i> and <i>Tristan</i>, and the music is also
suggestive of Wagnerian influence. D&rsquo;Indy can scarcely be
considered so typical a representative of modern French music as
his juniors Alfred Bruneau, the composer of <i>Le RÃªve</i>, <i>L&rsquo;Attaque du
moulin</i>, <i>Messidor</i>, or Gustave Charpentier, the author of <i>Louise</i>,
who chose subjects of modern life for their operatic works.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DINGELSTEDT, FRANZ VON<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (1814-1881), German poet and
dramatist, was born at Halsdorf, in Hesse Cassel, on the 30th of
June 1814. Having studied at the university of Marburg, he
became in 1836 a master at the Lyceum in Cassel, from which he
was transferred to Fulda in 1838. In 1839 he produced a novel,
<i>Unter der Erde</i>, which obtained considerable success, and in 1841
published the book by which he is best remembered, the <i>Lieder
eines kosmopolitischen NachtwÃ¤chters</i>. These poems, animated
as they are by a spirit of bitter opposition to everything that
savours of despotism, were an effective contribution to the
political poetry of the day. The popularity of this book
determined Dingelstedt to take up a literary career, and in 1841
he obtained an appointment on the staff of the <i>Augsburger
allgemeine Zeitung</i>. In 1843, however, the satirist of German
princes accepted, to the general surprise, the appointment of
private librarian to the king of WÃ¼rttemberg, and in the same year
he married the celebrated Bohemian opera singer, Jenny Lutzer.
In 1845 he published a volume of poems, some of which, treating
of modern life, possessed great literary rather than strictly
poetical merit. A subsequent collection, published in 1852,
attracted little attention. The success of his tragedy <i>Das Haus
der Barneveldt</i> (1850) obtained for him the position of intendant
at the court theatre at Munich, where he soon became the centre
of literary society. He incurred, however, the animosity of the
Jesuit clique at the court, and in 1856 was suddenly dismissed on
the most frivolous charges. A similar position was offered to him
at Weimar through the influence of Liszt, and he remained there
until 1867. His administration was most successful, and he
especially distinguished himself by presenting all Shakespeare&rsquo;s
historical plays upon the stage in an unbroken cycle. In 1867 he
became director of the court opera house in Vienna, and in 1872
of the Hofburgtheater, a position he held until his death on the
15th of May 1881. Among his other works may be noticed an
autobiographical sketch of his Munich career, entitled <i>MÃ¼nchener
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
Bilderbogen</i> (1879), <i>Die Amazone</i>, an art novel of considerable
merit (1869), translations of several of Shakespeare&rsquo;s comedies,
and several writings dealing with questions of practical dramaturgy.
He was ennobled in 1867 by the king of Bavaria and in
1876 was created <i>Freiherr</i> by the emperor of Austria.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DINGLE,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> a seaport and market town of county Kerry, Ireland,

into the Atlantic on the south-western coast of Ireland, on
the fine natural harbour of Dingle Bay, in a wild hilly district
abundant in relics of antiquity. The town, which is the centre
of a considerable fishing industry, especially in mackerel, was in

a noted manufacture of linen. It was incorporated by Queen
Elizabeth, and returned two members to the Irish parliament

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DINGO,<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> a name applied apparently by Europeans to the
warrigal, or native Australian dog, the Canis dingo of J. F.
Blumenbach. The dingo is a stoutly-built, rather short-legged,
sandy-coloured dog, intermediate in size between a jackal and a
wolf, and measuring about 51 in. in total length, of which the
tail takes up about eleven. In general appearance it is very like
some of the pariah dogs of India and Egypt; and, except on
distributional grounds, there is no reason for regarding it as
specifically distinct from such breeds. Dingos, which are found
both wild and tame, interbreed freely with European dogs introduced
into the country, and it may be that the large amount
of black on the back of many specimens may be the result of
crossing of this nature.</p>

<p>The main point of interest connected with the dingo relates to
its origin; that is to say, whether it is a member of the indigenous
Australian fauna (among which it is the only large placental
mammal), or whether it has been introduced into the country
by man. There seems to be no doubt that fossilized remains of
the dingo occur intermingled with those of the extinct Australian
mammals, such as giant kangaroos, giant wombats and the still
more gigantic <i>Diprotodon</i>. And since remains of man have
apparently not yet been detected in these deposits, it has been
thought by some naturalists that the dingo must be an indigenous
species. This was the opinion of Sir Frederick McCoy, by whom
the deposits in question were regarded as probably of Pliocene age.
A similar view is adopted by D. Ogilvy in a <i>Catalogue of Australian
Mammals</i>, published at Sydney in 1892; the writer going however
one step further and expressing the belief that the dingo
is the ancestor of all domesticated dogs. The latter contention
cannot for a moment be sustained; and there are also strong
arguments against the indigenous origin of the dingo. That the
animal now occurs in a wild state is no argument whatever as to
its being indigenous, seeing that a domesticated breed introduced
by man into a new country abounding in game would almost
certainly revert to the wild state. The apparent absence of
human remains in the beds yielding dingo teeth and bones (which
are almost certainly not older than the Pleistocene) is of only
negative value, and liable to be upset by new discoveries. Then,
again (as has been pointed out by R. I. Pocock in the first part of
the <i>Kennel Encyclopaedia</i>, 1907), the absence of any really wild
species of the typical group of the genus <i>Canis</i> between Burma
and Siam on the one hand and Australia on the other is a very
strong argument against the dingo being indigenous, seeing that,
whether brought by man or having travelled thither of its own
accord, the dingo must have reached its present habitat by way
of the Austro-Malay archipelago. If it had followed that route
in the course of nature, it is inconceivable that it would not still
be found on some portions of the route. On the supposition that
the dingo was introduced by man, we have now fairly decisive
evidence that the native Australian, in place of being (as formerly
supposed) a member of the negro stock, is a low type of Caucasian
allied to the Veddahs of Ceylon and the Toalas of Celebes.
Consequently the Australian natives must be presumed to have
reached the island-continent by way of Malaya; and if this be
admitted, nothing is more likely than that they should have been
accompanied by pariah dogs of the Indian type. Confirmation of
this is afforded by the occurrence in the mountains of Java of a
pariah-like dog which has reverted to an almost completely wild
condition; and likewise by the fact that the old voyagers met
with dogs more or less similar to the dingo in New Guinea, New
Zealand and the Solomon and certain other of the smaller Pacific
islands. On the whole, then, the most probable explanation of
the case is that the dingo is an introduced species closely allied to
the Indian pariah dog. Whether the latter represents a truly wild
type now extinct, cannot be determined. If so, all pariahs should
be classed with the Australian warrigal under the name of <i>Canis
dingo</i>. If, on the other hand, pariahs, and consequently the dingo,
cannot be separated specifically from the domesticated dogs of
western Europe, then the dingo should be designated <i>Canis
familiaris dingo</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DINGWALL,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> a royal and police burgh and county town of the
shire of Ross and Cromarty, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 2519. It is
situated near the head of Cromarty Firth where the valley of the
Peffery unites with the alluvial lands at the mouth of the Conon,
18Â½ m. N.W. of Inverness by the Highland railway. Its name,
derived from the Scandinavian <i>ThingvÃ¶llr</i>, &ldquo;field or meeting-place
of the <i>thing</i>,&rdquo; or local assembly, preserves the Norse origin of
the town; its Gaelic designation is Inverpefferon, &ldquo;the mouth of
the Peffery.&rdquo; The 18th-century town house, and some remains
of the ancient mansion of the once powerful earls of Ross still
exist. There is also a public park. An obelisk, 57 ft. high, was
erected over the grave of the 1st earl of Cromarty. The town
belongs to the Wick district group of parliamentary burghs. It is
a flourishing distributing centre and has an important corn market
and auction marts. Some shipping is carried on at the harbour
at the mouth of the Peffery, about a mile below the burgh.
Branch lines of the Highland railway run to Strathpeffer and to
Strome Ferry and Kyle of Lochalsh (for Skye). Alexander II.
created Dingwall a royal borough in 1226, and its charter was
renewed by James IV. On the top of Knockfarrel (Gaelic, <i>cnoc</i>,

<p><span class="bold">DINKA<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (called by the Arabs <i>Jange</i>), a widely spread negro
people dwelling on the right bank of the White Nile to about
12Â° N., around the mouth of the Babr-el-Ghazal, along the right
bank of that river and on the banks of the lower Sobat. Like the
Shilluk, they were greatly harried from the north by Nuba-Arabic
tribes, but remained comparatively free owing to the vast
extent of their country, estimated to cover 40,000 sq. m., and their
energy in defending themselves. They are a tall race with skins
of almost blue black. The men wear practically no clothes,
married women having a short apron, and unmarried girls a
fringe of iron cones round the waist. They tattoo themselves
with tribal marks, and extract the lower incisors; they also
pierce the ears and lip for the attachment of ornaments, and wear
a variety of feather, iron, ivory and brass ornaments. Nearly
all shave the head, but some give the hair a reddish colour by
moistening it with animal matter. Polygamy is general; some
headmen have as many as thirty or more wives; but six is the
average number. They are great cattle and sheep breeders; the
men tend their beasts with great devotion, despising agriculture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>
which is left to the women; the cattle are called by means of
drums. Save under stress of famine cattle are never killed
for food, the people subsisting largely on durra. The Dinkas
reverence the cow, and snakes, which they call &ldquo;brothers.&rdquo;
Their folklore recognizes a good and evil deity; one of the two
wives of the good deity created man, and the dead go to live with
him in a great park filled with animals of enormous size. The
evil deity created cripples. The Dinka came, in 1899, under the
control of the Sudan government, justice being administered
as far as possible in accord with tribal custom. A compendium
of Dinka laws was compiled by Captain H. D. E. O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p>

H. Lachmann), a group of Protozoa,
characterized as Mastigophora,
provided with two flagella,
the one anterior extended in locomotion,
the other coiled round
its base, or lying in a transverse
groove. The body is bounded by a firm pellicle, often supplemented
by an armour (&ldquo;lorica&rdquo;) of cuticular cellulose plates,
with usually a marked longitudinal groove from which the
anterior flagellum springs, and an oblique or spiral transverse
groove for the second flagellum. In <i>Polykrikos</i> (fig. 2, 9) there
are eight transverse grooves each with its flagellum. The
armour-plates are often exquisitely sculptured, and may be
produced into spines or perpendicular plates to give greater
surface extension, as we find in other plankton organisms.
The cortical plasma may protrude pseudopodia in the longitudinal
groove; it contains trichocysts in several species, true
nematocysts in <i>Polykrikos</i>. It contains chromatophores in
many species, coloured by a mixed lipochrome pigment which
appears to be distinct from diatomin. The endoplasm is
ramified between alveoli; it contains a large nucleus (in
<i>Polykrikos</i> there are eight nuclei, accompanied by smaller,
more numerous bodies regarded by O. Butschli as micro-nuclei).
Besides the other spaces are definite rounded or oval
vacuoles with a permanent pellicular wall termed by Schutt
&ldquo;pusules&rdquo;; these open by a duct or ducts into the longitudinal
groove. They enlarge and diminish, and are possibly excretory
like the &ldquo;contractile vacuoles&rdquo; of other Protista; though it has
been suggested that by their communication with the medium
they subserve nutrition. Nutrition is of course holozoic or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
saprophytic in the colourless forms, holophytic in the coloured;
but these divergent methods are exhibited by different species
of the same genus, or even by individuals of one and the same
species under different conditions. Binary fission has been
widely observed, both in the active condition or after loss of
the flagella: it differs from that of true Flagellates in not
being longitudinal, but transverse or oblique (fig, 2, 2). Repeated
fission (brood-formation) within a cyst has also been
observed, as in <i>Pyrocystis</i> and <i>Ceratium</i>; and possibly the chains
of <i>Ceratium</i> and other (fig. 2, 5 and 6) genera are due to the non-separation
of the brood-cells. Conjugation of adults has been
observed in several species, the most complete account being that
of Zederbauer on <i>Ceratium hirundinella</i> (marine): either mate
puts forth a tube which meets and opens into that of the

and some by their abundance colour the water of the sea or pool
which they dwell in. Like so many coloured Protista, they
frequently possess a pigmented &ldquo;eye-spot&rdquo; in which may be

<p><span class="bold">DINWIDDIE, ROBERT<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (1693-1770), English colonial governor
of Virginia, was born near Glasgow, Scotland, in 1693. From the
position of customs clerk in Bermuda, which he held in 1727-1738,
he was promoted to be surveyor-general of the customs &ldquo;of
the southern ports of the continent of America,&rdquo; as a reward
for having exposed the corruption in the West Indian customs
service. In 1743 he was commissioned to examine into the
customs service in the Barbadoes and exposed similar corruption
there. In 1751-1758 he was lieutenant-governor of Virginia,
first as the deputy of Lord Albemarle and then, from July 1756 to
January 1758, as deputy for Lord Loudon. He was energetic in
the discharge of his duties, but aroused much animosity among
the colonists by his zeal in looking after the royal quit-rents, and
by exacting heavy fees for the issue of land-patents. It was his
chief concern to prevent the French from building in the Ohio
Valley a chain of forts connecting their settlements in the north
with those on the Gulf of Mexico; and in the autumn of 1753 he
sent George Washington to Fort Le B&oelig;uf, a newly established
French post at what is now Waterford, Pennsylvania, with a
message demanding the withdrawal of the French from English
territory. As the French refused to comply, Dinwiddie secured
from the reluctant Virginia assembly a grant of Â£10,000 and in the
spring of 1754 he sent Washington with an armed force toward
the forks of the Ohio river &ldquo;to prevent the intentions of the
French in settling those lands.&rdquo; In the latter part of May
Washington encountered a French force at a spot called Great
Meadows, near the Youghiogheny river, in what is now south-western
Pennsylvania, and a skirmish followed which precipitated
the French and Indian War. Dinwiddie was especially active at
this time in urging the co-operation of the colonies against the
French in the Ohio Valley; but none of the other governors,
except William Shirley of Massachusetts, was then much concerned
about the western frontier, and he could accomplish very
little. His appeals to the home government, however, resulted in
the sending of General Edward Braddock to Virginia with two
regiments of regular troops; and at Braddock&rsquo;s call Dinwiddie
and the governors of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania
and Maryland met at Alexandria, Virginia, in April 1755, and
planned the initial operations of the war. Dinwiddie&rsquo;s administration
was marked by a constant wrangle with the assembly over
money matters; and its obstinate resistance to military appropriations
caused him in 1754 and 1755 to urge the home government
to secure an act of parliament compelling the colonies
to raise money for their protection. In January 1758 he left
Virginia and lived in England until his death on the 27th of July
1770 at Clifton, Bristol.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIO CASSIUS<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (more correctly <span class="sc">Cassius Dio</span>), <span class="sc">Cocceianus</span>
(c. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 150-235), Roman historian, was born at Nicaea in
Bithynia. His father was Cassius Apronianus, governor of
Dalmatia and Cilicia under Marcus Aurelius, and on his mother&rsquo;s
side he was the grandson of Dio Chrysostom, who had assumed
the surname of Cocceianus in honour of his patron the emperor
Cocceius Nerva. After his father&rsquo;s death, Dio Cassius left
Cilicia for Rome (180) and became a member of the senate.
During the reign of Commodus, Dio practised as an advocate at
the Roman bar, and held the offices of aedile and quaestor. He
was raised to the praetorship by Pertinax (193), but did not
assume office till the reign of Septimius Severus, with whom he
was for a long time on the most intimate footing. By Macrinus
he was entrusted with the administration of Pergamum and
Smyrna; and on his return to Rome he was raised to the
consulship about 220. After this he obtained the proconsulship
of Africa, and again on his return was sent as legate successively
to Dalmatia and Pannonia. He was raised a second time to
the consulship by Alexander Severus, in 229; but on the plea
of ill health soon afterwards retired to Nicaea, where he died.
Before writing his history of Rome (<span class="grk" title="RhÃ´maika">&#8190;&#929;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span> or <span class="grk" title="RhÃ´maikÃª

an account of various dreams and prodigies which had
presaged his elevation to the throne (perhaps the <span class="grk" title="Enodia">&#904;&#957;&#972;&#948;&#953;&#945;</span>
attributed to Dio by Suidas), and had also written a biography
of his fellow-countryman Arrian. The history of Rome, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
consisted of eighty books,&mdash;and, after the example of Livy, was
divided into decades,&mdash;began with the landing of Aeneas in Italy,
and was continued as far as the reign of Alexander Severus
(222-235). Of this great work we possess books 36-60, containing
the history of events from 68 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>-<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 47; books 36 and
55-60 are imperfect. We also have part of 35 and 36-80 in the
epitome of John Xiphilinus, an 11th-century Byzantine monk.
For the earlier period the loss of Dio&rsquo;s work is partly supplied
by the history of Zonaras, who followed him closely. Numerous
fragments are also contained in the excerpts of Constantine
Porphyrogenitus. Dio&rsquo;s work is a most important authority for
the history of the last years of the republic and the early empire.
His industry was great and the various important offices he held
afforded him ample opportunities for historical investigation.
His style, though marred by Latinisms, is clearer than that of
his model Thucydides, and his narrative shows the hand of the
practised soldier and politician; the language is correct and
free from affectation. But he displays a superstitious regard
for miracles and prophecies; he has nothing to say against the
arbitrary acts of the emperors, which he seems to take as a matter
of course; and his work, although far more than a mere compilation,
is not remarkable for impartiality, vigour of judgment or
critical historical faculty.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIOCESE<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (formed on Fr. <i>diocÃ¨se</i>, in place of the Eng. form
<i>diocess</i>&mdash;current until the 19th century&mdash;from Lat. <i>dioecesis</i>,
med. Lat. variant <i>diocesis</i>, from Gr. <span class="grk" title="dioikÃªsis">&#948;&#953;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;housekeeping,&rdquo;
&ldquo;administration,&rdquo; <span class="grk" title="dioikein">&#948;&#953;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, &ldquo;to keep house,&rdquo; &ldquo;to
govern&rdquo;), the sphere of a bishop&rsquo;s jurisdiction. In this, its
sole modern sense, the word diocese (<i>dioecesis</i>) has only been
regularly used since the 9th century, though isolated instances of
such use occur so early as the 3rd, what is now known as a diocese
having been till then usually called a <i>parochia</i> (parish). The
Greek word <span class="grk" title="dioikÃªsis">&#948;&#953;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, from meaning &ldquo;administration,&rdquo; came
to be applied to the territorial circumscription in which administration
was exercised. It was thus first applied <i>e.g.</i> to the
three districts of Cibyra, Apamea and Synnada, which were added
to Cilicia in Cicero&rsquo;s time (between 56 and 50 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>). The word
is here equivalent to &ldquo;assize-districts&rdquo; (Tyrrell and Purser&rsquo;s
edition of Cicero <i>Epist. ad fam.</i> iii. 8. 4; xiii. 67; cf. Strabo
xiii. 628-629). But in the reorganization of the empire, begun
by Diocletian and completed by Constantine, the word &ldquo;diocese&rdquo;
acquired a more important meaning, the empire being divided
into twelve dioceses, of which the largest&mdash;Oriens&mdash;embraced
sixteen provinces, and the smallest&mdash;Britain&mdash;four (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a></span>:
<i>Ancient History</i>; and W. T. Arnold, <i>Roman Provincial Administration</i>,
pp. 187, 194-196, which gives a list of the dioceses and
their subdivisions). The organization of the Christian church in
the Roman empire following very closely the lines of the civil
administration (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Church History</a></span>), the word diocese, in its
ecclesiastical sense, was at first applied to the sphere of jurisdiction,
not of a bishop, but of a metropolitan.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Thus Anastasius
Bibliothecarius (d. c. 886), in his life of Pope Dionysius, says that
he assigned churches to the presbyters, and established dioceses
(<i>parochiae</i>) and provinces (<i>dioeceses</i>). The word, however, survived
in its general sense of &ldquo;office&rdquo; or &ldquo;administration,&rdquo; and
it was even used during the middle ages for &ldquo;parish&rdquo; (see Du
Cange, <i>Glossarium</i>, s. &ldquo;Dioecesis&rdquo; 2).</p>

<p>The practice, under the Roman empire, of making the areas of
ecclesiastical administration very exactly coincide with those of
the civil administration, was continued in the organization of the
church beyond the borders of the empire, and many dioceses to
this day preserve the limits of long vanished political divisions.
The process is well illustrated in the case of English bishoprics.
But this practice was based on convenience, not principle; and
the limits of the dioceses, once fixed, did not usually change with
the changing political boundaries. Thus Hincmar, archbishop
of Reims, complains that not only his metropolitanate (<i>dioecesis</i>)
but his bishopric (<i>parochia</i>) is divided between two realms under
two kings; and this inconvenient overlapping of jurisdictions
remained, in fact, very common in Europe until the readjustments
of national boundaries by the territorial settlements of the
19th century. In principle, however, the subdivision of a diocese,
in the event of the work becoming too heavy for one bishop,
was very early admitted, <i>e.g.</i> by the first council at Lugo in Spain
(569), which erected Lugo into a metropolitanate, the consequent
division of diocese being confirmed by the king of the second
council, held in 572. Another reason for dividing a diocese, and
establishing a new see, has been recognized by the church as
duly existing &ldquo;if the sovereign should think fit to endow some
principal village or town with the rank and privileges of a
city&rdquo; (Bingham, lib. xvii. c. 5). But there are canons for the
punishment of such as might induce the sovereign so to erect
any town into a city, solely with the view of becoming bishop
thereof. Nor could any diocese be divided without the consent
of the primate.</p>

<p>In England an act of parliament is necessary for the creation of
new dioceses. In the reign of Henry VIII. six new dioceses were
thus created (under an act of 1539); but from that time onward
until the 19th century they remained practically unchanged.
The Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1836, which created two
new dioceses (Ripon and Manchester), remodelled the state of the
old dioceses by an entirely new adjustment of the revenues and
patronage of each see, and also extended or curtailed the parishes
and counties in the various jurisdictions.</p>

<p>By the ancient custom of the church the bishop takes his title,
not from his diocese, but from his see, <i>i.e.</i> the place where his
cathedral is established. Thus the old episcopal titles are all
derived from cities. This tradition has been broken, however, by
the modern practice of bishops in the United States and the
British colonies, <i>e.g.</i> archbishop of the West Indies, bishop of
Pennsylvania, Wyoming, &amp;c. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bishop</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIO CHRYSOSTOM<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> (c. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 40-115), Greek sophist and
rhetorician, was born at Piusa (mod. <i>Brusa</i>), a town at the foot
of Mount Olympus in Bithynia. He was called Chrysostom
(&ldquo;golden-mouthed&rdquo;) from his eloquence, and also to distinguish
him from his grandson, the historian Dio Cassius; his surname
Cocceianus was derived from his patron, the emperor Cocceius
Nerva. Although he did much to promote the welfare of his
native place, he became so unpopular there that he migrated to
Rome, but, having incurred the suspicion of Domitian, he was
banished from Italy. With nothing in his pocket but Plato&rsquo;s
<i>Phaedo</i> and Demosthenes&rsquo; <i>De falsa legatione</i>, he wandered about
in Thrace, Mysia, Scythia and the land of the Getae. He
returned to Rome on the accession of Nerva, with whom and
his successor Trajan he was on intimate terms. During this
period he paid a visit to Prusa, but, disgusted at his reception,
he went back to Rome. The place and date of his death are
unknown; it is certain, however, that he was alive in 112, when
the younger Pliny was governor of Bithynia.</p>

<p>Eighty orations, or rather essays on political, moral and
philosophical subjects, have come down to us under his name;
the <i>Corinthiaca</i>, however, is generally regarded as spurious, and
is probably the work of Favorinus of Arelate. Of the extant
orations the following are the most important:&mdash;<i>Borysthenitica</i>
(xxxvi.), on the advantages of monarchy, addressed to the
inhabitants of Olbia, and containing interesting information on the
history of the Greek colonies on the shores of the Black Sea;
<i>Olympica</i> (xii.), in which Pheidias is represented as setting forth
the principles which he had followed in his statue of Zeus, one
passage being supposed by some to have suggested Lessing&rsquo;s
<i>Laocoon</i>; <i>Rhodiaca</i> (xxxi.), an attack on the Rhodians for altering
the names on their statues, and thus converting them into
memorials of famous men of the day (an imitation of Demosthenes&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
<i>Leptines</i>); <i>De regno</i> (i.-iv.), addressed to Trajan, a eulogy of the
monarchical form of government, under which the emperor is the
representative of Zeus upon earth; <i>De Aeschylo et Sophocle et
Euripide</i> (lii.), a comparison of the treatment of the story of
Philoctetes by the three great Greek tragedians; and <i>Philoctetes</i>
(lix.), a summary of the prologue to the lost play by Euripides.
In his later life, Dio, who had originally attacked the philosophers,
himself became a convert to Stoicism. To this period belong the
essays on moral subjects, such as the denunciation of various
cities (Tarsus, Alexandria) for their immorality. Most pleasing
of all is the <i>Euboica</i> (vii.), a description of the simple life of the
herdsmen and huntsmen of Euboea as contrasted with that of the
inhabitants of the towns. <i>Troica</i> (xi.), an attempt to prove to
the inhabitants of Ilium that Homer was a liar and that Troy was
never taken, is a good example of a sophistical rhetorical exercise.
Amongst his lost works were attacks on philosophers and
Domitian, and <i>Getica</i> (wrongly attributed to Dio Cassius by
SuÃ¯das), an account of the manners and customs of the Getae, for
which he had collected material on the spot during his banishment.
The style of Dio, who took Plato and Xenophon especially
as his models, is pure and refined, and on the whole free from
rhetorical exaggeration. With Plutarch he played an important
part in the revival of Greek literature at the end of the 1st
century of the Christian era.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIOCLETIAN<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus</span>)
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 245-313), Roman emperor 284-305, is said to have been
born at Dioclea, near Salona, in Dalmatia. His original name
was Diocles. Of humble origin, he served with high distinction
and held important military commands under the emperors
Probus and Aurelian, and accompanied Carus to the Persian War.
After the death of Numerianus he was chosen emperor by the
troops at Chalcedon, on the 17th of September 284, and slew with
his own hands Arrius Aper, the praefect of the praetorians. He
thus fulfilled the prediction of a druidess of Gaul, that he would
mount a throne as soon as he had slain a wild boar (<i>aper</i>). Having
been installed at Nicomedia, he received general acknowledgment
after the murder of Carinus. In consequence of the rising of
the Bagaudae in Gaul, and the threatening attitude of the German
peoples on the Rhine, he appointed Maximian Augustus in 286;
and, in view of further dangers and disturbances in the empire,
proclaimed Constantius Chlorus and Galerius Caesars in 293. Each
of the four rulers was placed at a separate capital&mdash;Nicomedia,
Mediolanum (Milan), Augusta Trevirorum (Trier), Sirmium.
This amounted to an entirely new organization of the empire, on
a plan commensurate with the work of government which it now
had to carry on. At the age of fifty-nine, exhausted with labour,
Diocletian abdicated his sovereignty on the 1st of May 305, and
retired to Salona, where he died eight years afterwards (others
give 316 as the year of his death). The end of his reign was
memorable for the persecution of the Christians. In defence of
this it may be urged that he hoped to strengthen the empire by
reviving the old religion, and that the church as an independent
state over whose inner life at least he possessed no influence,
appeared to be a standing menace to his authority. Under
Diocletian the senate became a political nonentity, the last traces
of republican institutions disappeared, and were replaced by
an absolute monarchy approaching to despotism. He wore the
royal diadem, assumed the title of lord, and introduced a complicated
system of ceremonial and etiquette, borrowed from the
East, in order to surround the monarchy and its representative
with mysterious sanctity. But at the same time he devoted
his energies to the improvement of the administration of the
empire; he reformed the standard of coinage, fixed the price
of provisions and other necessaries of daily life, remitted the
tax upon inheritances and manumissions, abolished various
monopolies, repressed corruption and encouraged trade. In

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIOCLETIAN, EDICT OF<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (<i>De pretiis rerum venalium</i>), an imperial
edict promulgated in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 301, fixing a maximum price for
provisions and other articles of commerce, and a maximum rate of
wages. Incomplete copies of it have been discovered at various
times in various places, the first (in Greek and Latin) in 1709, at
Stratonicea in Caria, by W. Sherard, British consul at Smyrna,
containing the preamble and the beginning of the tables down to
No. 403. This partial copy was completed by W. Bankes in 1817.
A second fragment (now in the museum at Aix in Provence) was
brought from Egypt in 1809; it supplements the preamble by
specifying the titles of the emperors and Caesars and the number
of times they had held them, whereby the date of publication can
be accurately determined. For other fragments and their localities
see <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</i> (iii., 1873, pp. 801 and 1055;
and supplement i, 1893, p. 1909); special mention may be made
of those of Elatea, Plataea and Megalopolis. Latin being the
official language all over the empire, there was no official Greek
translation (except for Greece proper), as is shown by the variations
in those portions of the text of which more than one Greek
version is extant. Further, all the fragments come from the
provinces which were under the jurisdiction of Diocletian, from
which it is argued that the edict was only published in the
eastern portion of the empire; certainly the phrase <i>universo orbi</i>
in the preamble is against this, but the words may merely be an
exaggerated description of Diocletian&rsquo;s special provinces, and if it
had been published in the western portion as well, it is curious
that no traces have been found of it. The articles mentioned
in the edict, which is chiefly interesting as giving their relative
values at the time, include cereals, wine, oil, meat, vegetables,
fruits, skins, leather, furs, foot-gear, timber, carpets, articles of
dress, and the wages range from the ordinary labourer to the
professional advocate. The unit of money was the denarius, not
the silver, but a copper coin introduced by Diocletian, of which
the value has been fixed approximately at <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>th of a penny. The
punishment for exceeding the prices fixed was death or deportation.
The edict was a well-intended but abortive attempt, in
great measure in the interests of the soldiers, to meet the distress
caused by several bad harvests and commercial speculation. The
actual effect was disastrous: the restrictions thus placed upon
commercial freedom brought about a disturbance of the food
supply in non-productive countries, many traders were ruined,
and the edict soon fell into abeyance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIODATI, GIOVANNI<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (1576-1649), Swiss Protestant divine,
was born at Geneva on the 6th of June 1576, of a noble family
originally belonging to Lucca, which had been expatriated on
account of its Protestantism. At the age of twenty-one he was
nominated professor of Hebrew at Geneva on the recommendation
of Theodor Beza. In 1606 he became professor of theology, in
1608 pastor, or parish minister, at Geneva, and in the following
year he succeeded Beza as professor of theology. As a preacher
he was eloquent, bold and fearless. He held a high place among
the reformers of Geneva, by whom he was sent on a mission to
France in 1614. He had previously visited Italy, and made the
acquaintance of Paolo Sarpi, whom he endeavoured unsuccessfully
to engage in a reformation movement. In 1618-1619 he
attended the synod of Dort, and took a prominent part in its
deliberations, being one of the six divines appointed to draw up
the account of its proceedings. He was a thorough Calvinist, and
entirely sympathized with the condemnation of the Arminians.
In 1645 he resigned his professorship, and died at Geneva on the
3rd of October 1649. Diodati is chiefly famous as the author of
the translation of the Bible into Italian (1603, edited with notes,
1607). He also undertook a translation of the Bible into French,
which appeared with notes in 1644. Among his other works are
his <i>Annotationes in Biblia</i> (1607), of which an English translation
(<i>Pious and Learned Annotations upon the Holy Bible</i>) was
published in London in 1648, and various polemical treatises,
such as <i>De fictitio Pontificiorum Purgatorio</i> (1619); <i>De justa
secessione Reformatorum ab Ecclesia Romana</i> (1628); <i>De
Antichristo</i>, &amp;c. He also published French translations of
Sarpi&rsquo;s <i>History of the Council of Trent</i>, and of Edwin Sandys&rsquo;s
<i>Account of the State of Religion in the West</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIODORUS CRONUS<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> (4th century <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), Greek philosopher of
the Megarian school. Practically nothing is known of his life.
Diogenes LaÃ«rtius (ii. 111) tells a story that, while staying at the
court of Ptolemy Soter, Diodorus was asked to solve a dialectical
subtlety by Stilpo. Not being able to answer on the spur of the
moment, he was nicknamed <span class="grk" title="ho Kronos">&#922;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> (the God, equivalent to
&ldquo;slowcoach&rdquo;) by Ptolemy. The story goes that he died of
shame at his failure. Strabo, however, says (xiv. 658; xvii. 838)
that he took the name from Apollonius, his master. Like the rest
of the Megarian school he revelled in verbal quibbles, proving that
motion and existence are impossible. His was the famous
sophism known as the <span class="grk" title="KyrieyÃ´n">&#922;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#973;&#969;&#957;</span>. The impossible cannot
result from the possible; a past event cannot become other than
it is; but if an event, at a given moment, had been possible, from
this possible would result something impossible; therefore the
original event was impossible. This problem was taken up by
Chrysippus, who admitted that he could not solve it. Apart
from these verbal gymnastics, Diodorus did not differ from
the Megarian school. From his great dialectical skill he earned
the title <span class="grk" title="ho dialektikos">&#8001; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>, or <span class="grk" title="dialektikÃ´tatos">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#974;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, a title which was
borne by his five daughters, who inherited his ability.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIODORUS SICULUS,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> Greek historian, born at Agyrium in
Sicily, lived in the times of Julius Caesar and Augustus. From
his own statements we learn that he travelled in Egypt between
60-57 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> and that he spent several years in Rome. The latest
event mentioned by him belongs to the year 21 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> He asserts
that he devoted thirty years to the composition of his history, and
that he undertook frequent and dangerous journeys in prosecution
of his historical researches. These assertions, however, find
little credit with recent critics. The history, to which Diodorus
gave the name <span class="grk" title="bibliothÃªkÃª historikÃª">&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#952;&#942;&#954;&#951; &#7985;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span> (<i>Bibliotheca historica</i>,
&ldquo;Historical Library&rdquo;), consisted of forty books, and was divided
into three parts. The first treats of the mythic history of the non-Hellenic,
and afterwards of the Hellenic tribes, to the destruction
of Troy; the second section ends with Alexander&rsquo;s death; and
the third continues the history as far as the beginning of Caesar&rsquo;s
Gallic War. Of this extensive work there are still extant only the
first five books, treating of the mythic history of the Egyptians,
Assyrians, Ethiopians and Greeks; and also the 11th to the 20th
books inclusive, beginning with the second Persian War, and ending
with the history of the successors of Alexander, previous to
the partition of the Macedonian empire (302). The rest exists
only in fragments preserved in Photius and the excerpts of
Constantine Porphyrogenitus. The faults of Diodorus arise
partly from the nature of the undertaking, and the awkward form
of annals into which he has thrown the historical portion of his
narrative. He shows none of the critical faculties of the historian,
merely setting down a number of unconnected details. His
narrative contains frequent repetitions and contradictions, is
without colouring, and monotonous; and his simple diction,
which stands intermediate between pure Attic and the colloquial
Greek of his time, enables us to detect in the narrative the
undigested fragments of the materials which he employed. In
spite of its defects, however, the <i>Bibliotheca</i> is of considerable
value as to some extent supplying the loss of the works of older
authors, from which it is compiled. Unfortunately, Diodorus
does not always quote his authorities, but his general sources of
information were&mdash;in history and chronology, Castor, Ephorus
and Apollodorus; in geography, Agatharchides and Artemidorus.
In special sections he followed special authorities&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in the
history of his native Sicily, Philistus and Timaeus.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIODOTUS,<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> Seleucid satrap of Bactria, who rebelled against
Antiochus II. (about 255) and became the founder of the Graeco-Bactrian
kingdom (Trogus, <i>Prol.</i> 41; Justin xli. 4, 5, where he is
wrongly called Theodotus; Strabo xi. 515). His power seems to
have extended over the neighbouring provinces. Arsaces, the
chieftain of the nomadic (Dahan) tribe of the Parni, fled before
him into Parthia and here became the founder of the Parthian
kingdom (Strabo l.c.). When Seleucus II. in 239 attempted to
subjugate the rebels in the east he seems to have united with him
against the Parthians (Justin xli. 4, 9). Soon afterwards he died
and was succeeded by his son Diodotus II., who concluded a peace
with the Parthians (Justin l.c.). Diodotus II. was killed by
another usurper, Euthydemus (Polyb. xi. 34, 2). Of Diodotus I.
we possess gold and silver coins, which imitate the coins of
Antiochus II.; on these he sometimes calls himself Soter, &ldquo;the
saviour.&rdquo; As the power of the Seleucids was weak and continually
attacked by Ptolemy II., the eastern provinces and
their Greek cities were exposed to the invasion of the nomadic
barbarians and threatened with destruction (Polyb. xi. 34, 5);
thus the erection of an independent kingdom may have been a
necessity and indeed an advantage to the Greeks, and this epithet
well deserved. Diodotus Soter appears also on coins struck in his
memory by the later Graeco-Bactrian kings Agathocles and
Antimachus. Cf. A. v. Sallet, <i>Die Nachfolger Alexanders d. Gr.
in Baktrien und Indien</i>; Percy Gardner, <i>Catal. of the Coins of the

<p><span class="bold">DIOGENES,<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> &ldquo;the Cynic,&rdquo; Greek philosopher, was born at
Sinope about 412 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and died in 323 at Corinth, according to
Diogenes LaÃ«rtius, on the day on which Alexander the Great died
at Babylon. His father, Icesias, a money-changer, was imprisoned
or exiled on the charge of adulterating the coinage. Diogenes was
included in the charge, and went to Athens with one attendant,
whom he dismissed, saying, &ldquo;If Manes can live without Diogenes,
why not Diogenes without Manes?&rdquo; Attracted by the ascetic
teaching of Antisthenes, he became his pupil, despite the brutality
with which he was received, and rapidly excelled his master both
in reputation and in the austerity of his life. The stories which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
are told of him are probably true; in any case, they serve
to illustrate the logical consistency of his character. He inured
himself to the vicissitudes of weather by living in a tub belonging
to the temple of Cybele. The single wooden bowl he possessed he
destroyed on seeing a peasant boy drink from the hollow of his
hands. On a voyage to Aegina he was captured by pirates and
sold as a slave in Crete to a Corinthian named Xeniades. Being
asked his trade, he replied that he knew no trade but that of
governing men, and that he wished to be sold to a man who
needed a master. As tutor to the two sons of Xeniades, he lived
in Corinth for the rest of his life, which he devoted entirely to
preaching the doctrines of virtuous self-control. At the Isthmian
games he lectured to large audiences who turned to him from
Antisthenes. It was, probably, at one of these festivals that he
craved from Alexander the single boon that he would not stand
between him and the sun, to which Alexander replied &ldquo;If I were
not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.&rdquo; On his death, about which
there exist several accounts, the Corinthians erected to his
memory a pillar on which there rested a dog of Parian marble.
His ethical teaching will be found in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cynics</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>).
It may suffice to say here that virtue, for him, consisted in
the avoidance of all physical pleasure; that pain and hunger
were positively helpful in the pursuit of goodness; that all the
artificial growths of society appeared to him incompatible with
truth and goodness; that moralization implies a return to nature
and simplicity. He has been credited with going to extremes of
impropriety in pursuance of these ideas; probably, however, his
reputation has suffered from the undoubted immorality of some of
his successors. Both in ancient and in modern times, his personality
has appealed strongly to sculptors and to painters. Ancient
busts exist in the museums of the Vatican, the Louvre and the
Capitol. The interview between Diogenes and Alexander is represented
in an ancient marble bas-relief found in the Villa Albani.
Rubens, Jordaens, Steen, Van der Werff, Jeaurat, Salvator Rosa
and Karel Dujardin have painted various episodes in his life.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIOGENES APOLLONIATES<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (c. 460 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), Greek natural
philosopher, was a native of Apollonia in Crete. Although of
Dorian stock, he wrote in the Ionic dialect, like all the <i>physiologi</i>
(physical philosophers). There seems no doubt that he lived some
time at Athens, where it is said that he became so unpopular
(probably owing to his supposed atheistical opinions) that his
life was in danger. The views of Diogenes are transferred in the
<i>Clouds</i> (264 ff.) of Aristophanes to Socrates. Like Anaximenes,
he believed air to be the one source of all being, and all other
substances to be derived from it by condensation and rarefaction.
His chief advance upon the doctrines of Anaximenes is that
he asserted air, the primal force, to be possessed of intelligence&mdash;&ldquo;the
air which stirred within him not only prompted, but instructed.
The air as the origin of all things is necessarily an
eternal, imperishable substance, but as soul it is also necessarily
endowed with consciousness.&rdquo; In fact, he belonged to the old
Ionian school, whose doctrines he modified by the theories of
his contemporary Anaxagoras, although he avoided his dualism.
His most important work was <span class="grk" title="Peri physeÃ´s">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span> (<i>De natura</i>), of
which considerable fragments are extant (chiefly in Simplicius);
it is possible that he wrote also Against the Sophists and <i>On the
Nature of Man</i>, to which the well-known fragment about the
veins would belong; possibly these discussions were subdivisions
of his great work.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIOGENES LAÃ‹RTIUS<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">LaÃ«rtius Diogenes</span>), the
biographer of the Greek philosophers, is supposed by some to have
received his surname from the town of LaÃ«rte in Cilicia, and by
others from the Roman family of the LaÃ«rtii. Of the circumstances
of his life we know nothing. He must have lived after
Sextus Empiricus (c. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 200), whom he mentions, and before
Stephanus of Byzantium (c. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 500), who quotes him. It is
probable that he flourished during the reign of Alexander Severus
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 222-235) and his successors. His own opinions are equally
uncertain. By some he was regarded as a Christian; but it seems
more probable that he was an Epicurean. The work by which
he is known professes to give an account of the lives and sayings
of the Greek philosophers. Although it is at best an uncritical
and unphilosophical compilation, its value, as giving us an insight
into the private life of the Greek sages, justly led Montaigne
to exclaim that he wished that instead of one LaÃ«rtius there had
been a dozen. He treats his subject in two divisions which he
describes as the Ionian and the Italian schools; the division is
quite unscientific. The biographies of the former begin with
Anaximander, and end with Clitomachus, Theophrastus and
Chrysippus; the latter begins with Pythagoras, and ends with
Epicurus. The Socratic school, with its various branches, is
classed with the Ionic; while the Eleatics and sceptics are
treated under the Italic. The whole of the last book is devoted to
Epicurus, and contains three most interesting letters addressed
to Herodotus, Pythocles and Menoeceus. His chief authorities
were Diocles of Magnesia&rsquo;s <i>Cursory Notice</i> (<span class="grk" title="EpidromÃª">&#904;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#942;</span>) <i>of Philosophers</i>
and Favorinus&rsquo;s <i>Miscellaneous History</i> and <i>Memoirs</i>.
From the statements of Burlaeus (Walter Burley, a 14th-century
monk) in his <i>De vita et moribus philosophorum</i> the text of
Diogenes seems to have been much fuller than that which we
now possess. In addition to the <i>Lives</i>, Diogenes was the author
of a work in verse on famous men, in various metres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIOGENIANUS,<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> of Heraclea on the Pontus (or in Caria), Greek

the author of an alphabetical lexicon, chiefly of poetical words,
abridged from the great lexicon (<span class="grk" title="Peri glossÃ´n">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#947;&#955;&#969;&#963;&#963;&#8182;&#957;</span>) of Pamphilus

poor students&rdquo;). It formed the basis of the lexicon, or rather
glossary, of Hesychius of Alexandria, which is described in the
preface as a new edition of the work of Diogenianus. We still
possess a collection of proverbs under his name, probably an
abridgment of the collection made by himself from his lexicon
(ed. by E. Leutsch and F. W. Schneidewin in <i>Paroemiographi

<p><span class="bold">DIOGNETUS, EPISTLE TO,<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> one of the early Christian apologies.
Diognetus, of whom nothing is really known, has expressed
a desire to know what Christianity really means&mdash;&ldquo;What is this
new race&rdquo; of men who are neither pagans nor Jews? &ldquo;What is
this new interest which has entered into men&rsquo;s lives now and not
before?&rdquo; The anonymous answer begins with a refutation of
the folly of worshipping idols, fashioned by human hands and
needing to be guarded if of precious material. The repulsive
smell of animal sacrifices is enough to show their monstrous
absurdity. Next Judaism is attacked. Jews abstain from
idolatry and worship one God, but they fall into the same error of
repulsive sacrifice, and have absurd superstitions about meats
and sabbaths, circumcision and new moons. So far the task is
easy; but the mystery of the Christian religion &ldquo;think not to
learn from man.&rdquo; A passage of great eloquence follows, showing
that Christians have no obvious peculiarities that mark them off
as a separate race. In spite of blameless lives they are hated.
Their home is in heaven, while they live on earth. &ldquo;In a word,
what the soul is in a body, this the Christians are in the
world.... The soul is enclosed in the body, and yet itself
holdeth the body together: so Christians are kept in the world
as in a prison-house, and yet they themselves hold the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
together.&rdquo; This strange life is inspired in them by the almighty
and invisible God, who sent no angel or subordinate messenger to
teach them, but His own Son by whom He created the universe.
No man could have known God, had He not thus declared
Himself. &ldquo;If thou too wouldst have this faith, learn first the
knowledge of the Father. For God loved men, for whose sake He
made the world.... Knowing Him, thou wilt love Him and imitate
His goodness; and marvel not if a man can imitate God; he
can, if God will.&rdquo; By kindness to the needy, by giving them what
God has given to him, a man can become &ldquo;a god of them that
receive, an imitator of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then shalt thou on earth behold
God&rsquo;s life in heaven; then shalt thou begin to speak the mysteries
of God.&rdquo; A few lines after this the letter suddenly breaks off.</p>

<p>Even this rapid summary may show that the writer was a man
of no ordinary power, and there is no other early Christian
writing outside the New Testament which appeals so strongly
to modern readers. The letter has been often classed with the
writings of the Apostolic Fathers, and in some ways it seems
to mark the transition from the sub-apostolic age to that of the
Apologists. Bishop Lightfoot, who speaks of the letter as &ldquo;one
of the noblest and most impressive of early Christian apologies,&rdquo;
places it c. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 150, and inclines to identify Diognetus with the
tutor of Marcus Aurelius. Harnack and others would place it
later, perhaps in the 3rd century. There are some striking
parallels in method and language to the Apology of Aristides
(<i>q.v.</i>), and also to the early &ldquo;Preaching of Peter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one manuscript which contained this letter perished by fire
at Strassburg in 1870, but happily it had been accurately collated
by Reuss nine years before. It formed part of a collection of
works supposed to be by Justin Martyr, and to this mistaken
attribution its preservation is no doubt due. Both thought and
language mark the author off entirely from Justin. The end
of the letter is lost, but there followed in the codex the end of
a homily,<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> which was attached without a break to the epistle:
this points to the loss in some earlier codex of pages containing
the end of the letter and the beginning of the homily.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIOMEDES,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> in Greek legend, son of Tydeus, one of the bravest
of the heroes of the Trojan War. In the <i>Iliad</i> he is the favourite
of Athena, by whose aid he not only overcomes all mortals who
venture to oppose him, but is even enabled to attack the gods. In
the post-Homeric story, he made his way with Odysseus by an
underground passage into the citadel of Troy and carried off the
Palladium, the presence of which within the walls secured Troy
against capture (Virgil, <i>Aeneid</i>, ii. 164). On his return to Argos,
finding that his wife had been unfaithful, he removed to Aetolia,
and thence to Daunia (Apulia), where he married the daughter of
King Daunus. He was buried or mysteriously disappeared on
one of the islands in the Adriatic called after him Diomedeae, his
sorrowing companions being changed into birds by the gods out
of compassion (Ovid, <i>Metam.</i> xiv. 457 ff.). He was the reputed
founder of Argyrippa (Arpi) and other Italian cities (<i>Aeneid</i>, xi.
243 ff.). He was worshipped as a hero not only in Greece, but on
the coast of the Adriatic, as at Thurii and Metapontum. At Argos,
his native place, during the festival of Athena, his shield was
carried through the streets as a relic, together with the Palladium,
and his statue was washed in the river Inachus.</p>

in three books, dedicated to a certain Athanasius. The third book
is the most important, as containing extracts from Suetonius&rsquo;s

and used the same sources independently. The works of both

<p><span class="bold">DION,<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> tyrant of Syracuse (408-353 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), the son of Hipparinus,
and brother-in-law of Dionysius the Elder. In his youth he was
an admirer and pupil of Plato, whom Dionysius had invited to
Syracuse; and he used every effort to inculcate the maxims of
his master in the mind of the tyrant. The stern morality of
Dion was distasteful to the younger Dionysius, and the historian
Philistus, a faithful supporter of despotic power, succeeded in
procuring his banishment on account of alleged intrigues with the
Carthaginians. The exiled philosopher retired to Athens, where
he was at first permitted to enjoy his revenues in peace; but the
intercession of Plato (who had again visited Syracuse to procure
Dion&rsquo;s recall) only served to exasperate the tyrant, and at length
provoked him to confiscate the property of Dion, and give his wife
to another. This last outrage roused Dion. Assembling a small
force at Zacynthus, he sailed to Sicily (357) and was received with
demonstrations of joy. Dionysius, who was in Italy, returned
to Sicily, but was defeated and obliged to flee. Dion himself was
soon after supplanted by the intrigues of Heracleides, and again
banished. The incompetency of the new leader and the cruelties
of Apollocrates, the son of Dionysius, soon led to his recall. He
had, however, scarcely made himself master of Sicily when the
people began to express their discontent with his tyrannical
conduct, and he was assassinated by Callippus, an Athenian
who had accompanied him in his expedition.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIONE,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> in the earliest Greek mythology, the wife of Zeus. As
such she is associated with Zeus NaÃ¯us (the god of fertilizing
moisture) at Dodona (Strabo vii. p. 329), by whose side she sits,
adorned with a bridal veil and garland and holding a sceptre. As
the oracle declined in importance, her place as the wife of Zeus
was taken by Hera. It is probable that in very early times the
cult of Dione existed in Athens, where she had an altar before the
Erechtheum. After her admission to the general religious system
of the Greeks, Dione was variously described. In the <i>Iliad</i>
(v. 370) she is the mother by Zeus of Aphrodite, who is herself in
later times called Dione (the epithet Dionaeus was given to Julius
Caesar as claiming descent from Venus). In Hesiod (<i>Theog.</i> 353)
she is one of the daughters of Oceanus; in Pherecydes (ap. schol.
<i>Iliad</i>, xviii. 486), one of the nymphs of Dodona, the nurses of
Dionysus; in Euripides (frag. 177), the mother of Dionysus; in
Hyginus (fab. 9. 82), the daughter of Atlas, wife of Tantalus and
mother of Pelops and Niobe. Others make her a Titanid, the
daughter of Uranus and Gaea (Apollodorus i. 1). Speaking
generally, Dione may be regarded as the female embodiment
of the attributes of Zeus, to whose name her own is related as
Juno (= Jovino) to Jupiter.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIONYSIA,<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> festivals in honour of the god Dionysus generally,
but in particular the festivals celebrated in Attica and by the
branches of the Attic-Ionic race in the islands and in Asia Minor.
In Attica there were two festivals annually. (1) The lesser
Dionysia, or <span class="grk" title="ta kat agrous">&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#7936;&#947;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span>, was held in the country places for
four days (about the 19th to the 22nd of December) at the first
tasting of the new wine. It was accompanied by songs, dance,
phallic processions and the impromptu performances of itinerant
players, who with others from the city thronged to take part in the
excitement of the rustic sports. A favourite amusement was the
Ascoliasmus, or dancing on one leg upon a leathern bag (<span class="grk" title="askos">&#7936;&#963;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>),
which had been smeared with oil. (2) The <i>greater</i> Dionysia, or
<span class="grk" title="ta en astei">&#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#957; &#7940;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;</span>, was held in the city of Athens for six days (about the
28th of March to the 2nd of April). This was a festival of joy at
the departure of winter and the promise of summer, Dionysus
being regarded as having delivered the people from the wants and
troubles of winter. The religious act of the festival was the
conveying of the ancient image of the god, which had been brought
from Eleutherae to Athens, from the ancient sanctuary of the
Lenaeum to a small temple near the Acropolis and back again,
with a chorus of boys and a procession carrying masks and singing
the dithyrambus. The festival culminated in the production of
tragedies, comedies and satyric dramas in the great theatre
of Dionysus. Other festivals in honour of Dionysus were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
Anthesteria (<i>q.v.</i>); the Lenaea (about the 28th to the 31st of January),
or festival of vats, at which, after a great public banquet, the
citizens went through the city in procession to attend the dramatic
representations; the Oschophoria (October-November), a vintage
festival, so called from the branches of vine with grapes carried
by twenty youths from the ephebi, two from each tribe, in a race
from the temple of Dionysus in Athens to the temple of Athena
Sciras in Phalerum.</p>

elected pope in 259 after the persecution of Valerian, fell the task
of reorganizing the Roman church, which had fallen into great
disorder. At the protest of some of the faithful at Alexandria,
he demanded from the bishop of Alexandria, also called Dionysius,
explanations touching his doctrine. He died on the 26th of
December 268.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIONYSIUS<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> (c. 432-367 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), tyrant of Syracuse, began life as
a clerk in a public office, but by courage and diplomacy succeeded
in making himself supreme (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Syracuse</a></span>). He carried on war
with Carthage with varying success; his attempts to drive the
Carthaginians entirely out of the island failed, and at his death
they were masters of at least a third of it. He also carried on an
expedition against Rhegium and its allied cities in Magna Graecia.
In one campaign, in which he was joined by the Lucanians, he
devastated the territories of Thurii, Croton and Locri. After a
protracted siege he took Rhegium (386), and sold the inhabitants
as slaves. He joined the Illyrians in an attempt to plunder the
temple of Delphi, pillaged the temple of Caere on the Etruscan
coast, and founded several military colonies on the Adriatic. In
the Peloponnesian War he espoused the side of the Spartans, and
assisted them with mercenaries. He also posed as an author and
patron of literature; his poems, severely criticized by Philoxenus,
were hissed at the Olympic games; but having gained a prize
for a tragedy on the <i>Ransom of Hector</i> at the Lenaea at Athens, he
was so elated that he engaged in a debauch which proved fatal.
According to others, he was poisoned by his physicians at the
instigation of his son. His life was written by Philistus, but the
work is not extant. Dionysius was regarded by the ancients as
a type of the worst kind of despot&mdash;cruel, suspicious and vindictive.
Like Peisistratus, he was fond of having distinguished
literary men about him, such as the historian Philistus, the poet
Philoxenus, and the philosopher Plato, but treated them in a most
arbitrary manner.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIONYSIUS AREOPAGITICUS<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (or &ldquo;the Areopagite&rdquo;), named
in Acts xvii. 34 as one of those Athenians who believed when they
had heard Paul preach on Mars Hill. Beyond this mention our
only knowledge of him is the statement of Dionysius, bishop of
Corinth (fl. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 171), recorded by Eusebius (<i>Church Hist.</i> iii. 4;
iv. 23), that this same Dionysius the Areopagite was the first
&ldquo;bishop&rdquo; of Athens. Some hundreds of years after the
Areopagite&rsquo;s death, his name was attached by the Pseudo-Areopagite
to certain theological writings composed by the latter.
These were destined to exert enormous influence upon medieval
thought, and their fame led to the extension of the personal legend
of the real Dionysius. Hilduin, abbot of St Denys (814-840),
identified him with St Denys, martyr and patron-saint of France.
In Hilduin&rsquo;s <i>Areopagitica</i>, the Life and Passion of the most holy
Dionysius (Migne, <i> Patrol. Lat.</i>  tome 106), the Areopagite is sent
to France by Clement of Rome, and suffers martyrdom upon the
hill where the monastery called St Denys was to rise in his honour.
There is no earlier trace of this identification, and Gregory of
Tours (d. 594) says (<i>Hist. Francorum</i>, i. 18) that St Denys came
to France in the reign of Decius (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 250), which falls about
midway between the presumptive death of the real Areopagite
and the probable date of the writings to which he owed his
adventitious fame.</p>

<p>Traces of the influence of these writings appear in the works
of Eastern theologians in the early part of the 6th century. They
also were cited at the council held in Constantinople in 533, which
is the first certain dated reference to them. In the West, Gregory
the Great (d. 604) refers to them in his thirty-fourth sermon on
the gospels (Migne, <i>Pat. Lat.</i>  tome 76, col. 1254). They did not,
however, become generally known in the Western church till after
the year 827, when the Byzantine emperor Michael the Stammerer
sent a copy to Louis the Pious. It was given over to the care of
the above-mentioned abbot Hilduin. In the next generation the
scholar and philosopher Joannes Scotus Erigena (<i>q.v.</i>) translated
the Dionysian writings into Latin. This appears to have been
the only Latin translation until the 12th century when another
was made, followed by several others.</p>

<p>Thus, the author, date and place of composition of these
writings are unknown. External evidence precludes a date later
than the year 500, and the internal evidence from the writings
themselves precludes any date prior to 4th-century phases of
Neo-platonism. The extant writings of the Pseudo-Areopagite
are: (a) <span class="grk" title="Peri tÃªs ouranias hierarchias">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>, <i>Concerning the Celestial

Mystic Theology</i>, in five chapters. (e) Ten letters addressed to
various worthies of the apostolic period.</p>

<p>Although these writings seem complete, they contain references
to others of the same author. But of the latter nothing
is known, and they may never have existed.</p>

<p>The writings of the Pseudo-Areopagite are of great interest,
first as a striking presentation of the heterogeneous elements that
might unite in the mind of a gifted man in the 5th century, and
secondly, because of their enormous influence upon subsequent
Christian theology and art. Their ingredients&mdash;Christian, Greek,
Oriental and Jewish&mdash;are not crudely mingled, but are united
into an organic system. Perhaps theological philosophic fantasy
has never constructed anything more remarkable. The system of
Dionysius was a proper product of its time,&mdash;lofty, apparently
complete, comparable to the <i>Enneads</i> of Plotinus which formed
part of its materials. But its materials abounded everywhere,
and offered themselves temptingly to the hand strong enough
to build with them. There was what had entered into Neo-platonism,
both in its dialectic form as established by Plotinus,
and in its magic-mystic modes devised by Iamblichus (d. c. 333).
There was Jewish angel lore and Eastern mood and fancy; and
there was Christianity so variously understood and heterogeneously
constituted among Syro-Judaic Hellenic communities.
Such Christianity held materials for formula and creed; also
principles of liturgic and sacramental doctrine and priestly
function; also a mass of popular beliefs as to intermediate
superhuman beings who seemed nearer to men than any member
of the Trinity.</p>

<p>Out of this vast spiritual conglomerate, Pseudo-Dionysius
formed his system. It was not juristic,&mdash;not Roman, Pauline
or Augustinian. Rather he borrowed his constructive principles
from Hellenism in its last great creation, Neo-platonism. That
had been able to gather and arrange within itself the various
elements of latter-day paganism. The Neo-platonic categories
might be altered in name and import, and yet the scheme remain
a scheme; since the general principle of the transmission of life
from the ultimate Source downward through orders of mediating
beings unto men, might readily be adapted to the Christian God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
and his ministering angels. Pseudo-Dionysius had lofty thoughts
of the sublime transcendence of the ultimate divine Source. That
source was not remote or inert; but a veritable Source from which
life streamed to all lower orders of existence,&mdash;in part directly,
and in part indirectly as power and guidance through the higher
orders to the lower. Life, creation, every good gift, is from God
directly; but his flaming ministers also intervene to guide and
aid the life of man; and the life which through love floods forth
from God has its counterflow whereby it draws its own creations
to itself. God is at once absolutely transcendent and universally
immanent. To live is to be united with God; evil is the nonexistent,
that is, severance from God. Whatever is, is part of
the forth-flowing divine life which ever purifies, enlightens and
perfects, and so draws all back to the Source.</p>

<p>The transcendent Source, as well as the universal immanence,
is the Triune God. Between that and men are ranged the
three triads of the Celestial Hierarchy: Seraphim, Cherubim
and Thrones; Dominations, Virtues, Powers; Principalities,
Archangels, Angels. Collectively their general office is to raise
mankind to God through purification, illumination and perfection;
and to all may be applied the term angel. The highest
triad, which is nearest God, contemplates the divine effulgence,
and reflects it onward to the second; the third, and more
specifically angelic triad, immediately ministers to men. The
sources of these names are evident: seraphim and cherubim are
from the Old Testament; later Jewish writings gave names to
archangels and angels, who also fill important functions in the New
Testament. The other names are from Paul (Eph. i. 21; Col. i. 16).</p>

<p>Such is the system of Pseudo-Dionysius, as presented mainly in
<i>The Celestial Hierarchy</i>. That work is followed by <i>The Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy</i>, its counterpart on earth. What the primal
triune Godhead is to the former, Jesus is to the latter. The
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy likewise is composed of Triads. The first
includes the symbolic sacraments: Baptism, Communion,
Consecration of the Holy Chrism. Baptism signifies purification;
Communion signifies enlightening; the Holy Chrism signifies
perfecting. The second triad is made up of the three orders of
Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, or rather, as the Areopagite
names them: Hierarchs, Light-bearers, Servitors. The third
triad consists of monks, who are in a state of perfection, the
initiated laity, who are in a state of illumination, and the
catechumens, in a state of purification. All worship, in this
treatise, is a celebration of mysteries, and the pagan mysteries are
continually suggested by the terms employed.</p>

<p>The work <i>Concerning the Divine Names</i> is a noble discussion of
the qualities which may be predicated of God, according to the
warrant of the terms applied to him in Scripture. The work
<i>Concerning Mystic Theology</i> explains the function of symbols, and
shows that he who would know God truly must rise above them
and above the conceptions of God drawn from sensible things.</p>

<p>The works of Pseudo-Dionysius began to influence theological
thought in the West from the time of their translation into Latin
by Erigena. Their use may be followed through the writings of
scholastic philosophers, <i>e.g.</i> Peter Lombard, Albertus Magnus,
Thomas Aquinas and many others. In poetry we find their
influence in Dante, Spenser, Milton. The fifteenth chapter of <i>The
Celestial Hierarchy</i> constituted the canon of symbolical angelic
lore for the literature and art of the middle ages. Therein the
author explains in what respect theology ascribes to angels the
qualities of fire, why the thrones are said to be <i>fiery</i> (<span class="grk" title="pyrinous">&#960;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span>);
why the seraphim are <i>burning</i> (<span class="grk" title="emprÃªstas">&#7952;&#956;&#960;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#962;</span>) as their name
indicates. The fiery form signifies, with Celestial Intelligences,
likeness to God. Dionysius explains the significance of the parts
of the human body when given to celestial beings: feet are
ascribed to angels to denote their unceasing movement on the
divine business, and their feet are winged to denote their celerity.
He likewise explains the symbolism of wands and axes, of brass
and precious stones, when joined to celestial beings; and what
wheels and a chariot denote when furnished to them,&mdash;and much
more besides.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIONYSIUS EXIGUUS,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> one of the most learned men of the
6th century, and especially distinguished as a chronologist, was,
according to the statement of his friend Cassiodorus, a Scythian
by birth, &ldquo;<i>Scytha natione</i>.&rdquo; This may mean only that he was a
native of the region bordering on the Black Sea, and does not
necessarily imply that he was not of Greek origin. Such origin is
indicated by his name and by his thorough familiarity with the
Greek language. His surname &ldquo;Exiguus&rdquo; is usually translated
&ldquo;the Little,&rdquo; but he probably assumed it out of humility. He
was living at Rome in the first half of the 6th century, and is
usually spoken of as abbot of a Roman monastery. Cassiodorus,
however, calls him simply &ldquo;monk,&rdquo; while Bede calls him &ldquo;abbot.&rdquo;
But as it was not unusual to apply the latter term to distinguished
monks who were not heads of their houses, it is uncertain whether
Dionysius was abbot in fact or only by courtesy. He was in high
repute as a learned theologian, was profoundly versed in the Holy
Scriptures and in canon law, and was also an accomplished
mathematician and astronomer. We owe to him a collection of
401 ecclesiastical canons, including the apostolical canons and the
decrees of the councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, Chalcedon and
Sardis, and also a collection of the decretals of the popes from
Siricius (385) to Anastasius II. (498). These collections, which
had great authority in the West (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Canon Law</a></span>), were published
by Justel in 1628. Dionysius did good service to his contemporaries
by his translations of many Greek works into Latin; and
by these translations some works, the originals of which have
perished, have been handed down to us. His name, however, is
now perhaps chiefly remembered for his chronological labours.
It was Dionysius who introduced the method of reckoning
the Christian era which we now use (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chronology</a></span>). His
friend Cassiodorus depicts in glowing terms the character of
Dionysius as a saintly ascetic, and praises his wisdom and
simplicity, his accomplishments and his lowly-mindedness, his
power of eloquent speech and his capacity of silence. He died at
Rome, some time before <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 550.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIONYSIUS HALICARNASSENSIS<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (&ldquo;of Halicarnassus&rdquo;),
Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, flourished during the reign
of Augustus. He went to Rome after the termination of the civil
wars, and spent twenty-two years in studying the Latin language
and literature and preparing materials for his history. During
this period he gave lessons in rhetoric, and enjoyed the society of
many distinguished men. The date of his death is unknown.
His great work, entitled <span class="grk" title="RÃ´maikÃª archaiologia">&#8190;&#929;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#8151;&#954;&#8052; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span> (Roman
Antiquities), embraced the history of Rome from the mythical
period to the beginning of the first Punic War. It was divided
into twenty books,&mdash;of which the first nine remain entire, the
tenth and eleventh are nearly complete, and the remaining books
exist in fragments in the excerpts of Constantine Porphyrogenitus
and an epitome discovered by Angelo Mai in a Milan MS. The
first three books of Appian, and Plutarch&rsquo;s <i>Life of Camillus</i> also
embody much of Dionysius. His chief object was to reconcile
the Greeks to the rule of Rome, by dilating upon the good
qualities of their conquerors. According to him, history is
philosophy teaching by examples, and this idea he has carried
out from the point of view of the Greek rhetorician. But he has
carefully consulted the best authorities, and his work and that of
Livy are the only connected and detailed extant accounts of early
Roman history.</p>

<p>Dionysius was also the author of several rhetorical treatises, in
which he shows that he has thoroughly studied the best Attic
models:&mdash;<i>The Art of Rhetoric</i> (which is rather a collection of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
essays on the theory of rhetoric), incomplete, and certainly not
all his work; <i>The Arrangement of Words</i> (<span class="grk" title="Peri syntheseÃ´s

to the different styles of oratory; <i>On Imitation</i> (<span class="grk" title="Peri

<p><span class="bold">DIONYSIUS TELMAHARENSIS<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (&ldquo;of Tell-Ma&#7717;r&#275;&rdquo;), patriarch
or supreme head of the Syrian Jacobite Church during the years
818-848, was born at Tell-Ma&#7717;r&#275; near Ra&#7731;&#7731;a (ar-Ra&#7731;&#7731;ah) on the
Bal&#299;kh. He was the author of an important historical work,
which has seemingly perished except for some passages quoted by
Barhebraeus and an extract found by Assemani in Cod. <i>Vat.</i> 144
and published by him in the <i>Bibliotheca orientalis</i> (ii. 72-77). He
spent his earlier years as a monk at the convent of &#7730;en-neshr&#275; on
the upper Euphrates; and when this monastery was destroyed by
fire in 815, he migrated northwards to that of Kais&#363;m in the
district of Samos&#257;ta. At the death of the Jacobite patriarch
Cyriacus in 817, the church was agitated by a dispute about the
use of the phrase &ldquo;heavenly bread&rdquo; in connexion with the
Eucharist. An anti-patriarch had been appointed in the person
of Abraham of &#7730;artam&#299;n, who insisted on the use of the phrase
in opposition to the recognized authorities of the church. The
council of bishops who met at Ra&#7731;&#7731;a in the summer of 818 to
choose a successor to Cyriacus had great difficulty in finding a
worthy occupant of the patriarchal chair, but finally agreed on
the election of Dionysius, hitherto known only as an honest monk
who devoted himself to historical studies. Sorely against his will
he was brought to Ra&#7731;&#7731;a, ordained deacon and priest on two
successive days, and raised to the supreme ecclesiastical dignity
on the 1st of August. From this time he showed the utmost zeal
in fulfilling the duties of his office, and undertook many journeys
both within and without his province. The ecclesiastical schism
continued unhealed during the thirty years of his patriarchate.
The details of this contest, of his relations with the caliph
Ma&rsquo;m&#363;n, and of his many travels&mdash;including a journey to Egypt,
on which he viewed with admiration the great Egyptian
monuments,&mdash;are to be found in the <i>Ecclesiastical Chronicle</i> of
Barhebraeus.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He died in 848, his last days having been especially
embittered by Mahommedan oppression. We learn from Michael
the Syrian that his <i>Annals</i> consisted of two parts each divided
into eight chapters, and covered a period of 260 years, viz. from
the accession of the emperor Maurice (582-583) to the death of
Theophilus (842-843).</p>

<p>In addition to the lost <i>Annals</i>, Dionysius was from the time of
Assemani until 1896 credited with the authorship of another important
historical work&mdash;a <i>Chronicle</i>, which in four parts narrates
the history of the world from the creation to the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 774-775
and is preserved entire in <i>Cod. Vat.</i> 162. The first part (edited by
Tullberg, Upsala, 1850) reaches to the epoch of Constantine the
Great, and is in the main an epitome of the Eusebian Chronicle.<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
The second part reaches to Theodosius II. and follows closely the
<i>Ecclesiastical History</i> of Socrates; while the third, extending to
Justin II., reproduces the second part of the <i>History</i> of John
of Asia or Ephesus, and also contains the well-known chronicle
attributed to Joshua the Stylite. The fourth part<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a> is not like the
others a compilation, but the original work of the author, and
reaches to the year 774-775&mdash;apparently the date when he was
writing. On the publication of this fourth part by M. Chabot, it
was discovered and clearly proved by NÃ¶ldeke (<i>Vienna Oriental
Journal</i>, x. 160-170), and Nau (<i>Bulletin critique</i>, xvii. 321-327),
who independently reached the same conclusion, that Assemani&rsquo;s
opinion was a mistake, and that the chronicle in question was the
work not of Dionysius of Tell-Ma&#7717;r&#275; but of an earlier writer, a
monk of the convent of Zu&#7731;n&#299;n near &#256;mid (Diarbekr) on the upper
Tigris. Though the author was a man of limited intelligence and
destitute of historical skill, yet the last part of his work at least
has considerable value as a contemporary account of events
during the middle period of the 8th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIONYSIUS THRAX<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> (so called because his father was a
Thracian), the author of the first Greek grammar, flourished about
100 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> He was a native of Alexandria, where he attended
the lectures of Aristarchus, and afterwards taught rhetoric in
Rhodes and Rome. His <span class="grk" title="TechnÃª grammatikÃª">&#932;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span>, which we possess
(though probably not in its original form), begins with the definition
of grammar and its functions. Dealing next with accent,
punctuation marks, sounds and syllables, it goes on to the different
parts of speech (eight in number) and their inflections. No rules
of syntax are given, and nothing is said about style. The
authorship of Dionysius was doubted by many of the early middle-age
commentators and grammarians, and in modern times its
origin has been attributed to the oecumenical college founded
by Constantine the Great, which continued in existence till 730.
But there seems no reason for doubt; the great grammarians
of imperial times (Apollonius Dyscolus and Herodian) were
acquainted with the work in its present form, although, as was
natural considering its popularity, additions and alterations may
have been made later. The <span class="grk" title="TechnÃª">&#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951;</span> was first edited by J. A.
Fabricius from a Hamburg MS. and published in his <i>Bibliotheca
Graeca</i>, vi. (ed. Harles). An Armenian translation, belonging to
the 4th or 5th century, containing five additional chapters, was
published with the Greek text and a French version, by M.
Cirbied (1830). Dionysius also contributed much to the criticism
and elucidation of Homer, and was the author of various other
works&mdash;amongst them an account of Rhodes, and a collection of
<span class="grk" title="Meletai">&#924;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> (literary studies), to which the considerable fragment in
the <i>Stromata</i> (v. 8) of Clement of Alexandria probably belongs.</p>

<span class="grk" title="nysos">&#957;&#8166;&#963;&#959;&#962;</span>, a Thracian word for &ldquo;son&rdquo;), in Greek mythology,
originally a nature god of fruitfulness and vegetation, especially
of the vine; hence, distinctively, the god of wine. The names

century), Sabazius, and Bassareus, are also Thracian names of
the god. The two first (like Iacchus, Bromius and Euios) have
been connected with the loud &ldquo;shout&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="sabazein = bazein =
eÃºazein">&#963;&#945;&#946;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; = &#946;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; = &#949;&#8016;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>) of his worshippers, Bassareus with <span class="grk" title="bassÃ¡rai">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#940;&#961;&#945;&#953;</span>, the
fox-skin garments of the Thracian Bacchanals. It has been
suggested (J. E. Harrison <i>Prolegomena to Greek Religion</i>)
that Sabazius and Bromius = &ldquo;beer-god,&rdquo; &ldquo;god of a cereal
intoxicant&rdquo; (cf. Illyrian <i>sabaia</i> and modern Greek <span class="grk" title="brÃ´mi">&#946;&#961;&#8182;&#956;&#953;</span>,
&ldquo;oats&rdquo;), while W. Ridgeway (<i>Classical Review</i>, January 1896),
comparing Apollo Smintheus, interprets Bassareus as &ldquo;he who
keeps away the foxes from the vineyards&rdquo; (for various interpretations
of these and other cult-titles, see O. Gruppe, <i>Griechische
Mythologie</i>, ii. pp. 1408, 1532, especially the notes).</p>

<p>In Homer, notwithstanding the frequent mention of the use of
wine, Dionysus is never mentioned as its inventor or introducer,
nor does he appear in Olympus; Hesiod is the first who calls
wine the gift of Dionysus. On the other hand, he is spoken of
in the <i>Iliad</i> (vi. 130 foll., a passage belonging to the latest period
of epic), as &ldquo;raging,&rdquo; an epithet that indicates that in those
comparatively early times the orgiastic character of his worship
was recognized. In fact, Dionysus may be regarded under two
distinct aspects: that of a popular national Greek god of wine
and cheerfulness, and that of a foreign deity, worshipped with
ecstatic and mysterious rites introduced from Thrace. According
to the usual tradition, he was born at Thebes&mdash;originally the
local centre of his worship in Greece&mdash;and was the son of Zeus,
the fertilizing rain god, and Semele, the daughter of Cadmus,
a personification of earth. Before the child was mature, Zeus
appeared to Semele at her request in his majesty as god of
lightning, by which she was killed, but the infant was saved
from the flames by Zeus (or Hermes). The epithet <span class="grk" title="perikionios">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#953;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>,
originally referring to an ivy-crowned, pillar-shaped fetish of the
god, afterwards gave rise to the legend of a miraculous growth of
ivy &ldquo;round the pillars&rdquo; of the royal palace, whereby the infant
Dionysus was preserved from the flames. Zeus took him up,
enclosed him within his own thigh till he came to maturity, and
then brought him to the light, so that he was twice born; it was
to celebrate this double birth that the <i>dithyrambus</i> (also used as
an epithet of the god) was sung (see <i>Etym. Mag. s.v.</i>). It has
been suggested that this is an allusion to the <i>couvade</i> of certain
barbarous tribes, amongst whom it is customary, when a child is
born, for the husband to take to his bed and receive medical treatment,
as if he shared the pains of maternity (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Couvade</a></span>,
and references there). Dionysus was then conveyed by Hermes
to be brought up by the nymphs of Nysa, a purely imaginary
spot, afterwards localized in different parts of the world, which
claimed the honour of having been the birthplace of the god. As
soon as Dionysus was grown up, he started on a journey through
the world, to teach the cultivation of the vine and spread his
worship among men. While so engaged he met with opposition,
even in his own country, as in the case of Pentheus, king of
Thebes, who opposed the orgiastic rites introduced by Dionysus
among the women of Thebes, and, having been discovered watching
one of these ceremonies, was mistaken for some animal of the
chase, and slain by his own mother (see A. G. Bather, <i>Journ. Hell.
Studies</i>, xiv. 1894). A similar instance is that of Lycurgus, a
Thracian king, from whose attack Dionysus saved himself by
leaping into the sea, where he was kindly received by Thetis.
Lycurgus was blinded by Zeus and soon died, or became frantic
and hewed down his own son, mistaking him for a vine. At
Orchomenus, the three daughters of Minyas refused to join the
other women in their nocturnal orgies, and for this were transformed
into birds (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Agrionia</a></span>). These and similar stories point
to the vigorous resistance offered to the introduction of the
mystic rites of Dionysus, in places where an established religion
already existed. On the other hand, when the god was received
hospitably he repaid the kindness by the gift of the vine, as in the
case of Icarius of Attica (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Erigone</a></span>).</p>

<p>The worship of Dionysus was actively conducted in Asia Minor,
particularly in Phrygia and Lydia. Here, as Sabazius, he was
associated with the Phrygian goddess Cybele, and was followed in
his expeditions by a <i>thiasos</i> (retinue) of centaurs, and satyrs, with
Pan and Silenus. In Lydia his triumphant return from India was
celebrated by an annual festival on Mount Tmolus; in Lydia
he assumed the long beard and long robe which were afterwards
given him in his character of the &ldquo;Indian Bacchus,&rdquo; the
conqueror of the East, who, after the campaigns of Alexander,
was reported to have advanced as far as the Ganges. The other
incidents in which he appears in a purely triumphal character are
his transforming into dolphins the Tyrrhene pirates who attacked
him, as told in the Homeric hymn to Dionysus and represented on
the monument of Lysicrates at Athens, and his part in the war of
the gods against the giants. The former story has been connected
with the sailors&rsquo; custom of hanging vine leaves, ivy and bunches
of grapes round the masts of vessels in honour of vintage festivals.
The adventure with the pirates occurred on his voyage to Naxos,
where he found Ariadne abandoned by Theseus. At Naxos
Ariadne (probably a Cretan goddess akin to Aphrodite) was
associated with Dionysus as his wife, by whom he was the father
of Oenopion (wine-drinker), Staphylus (grape), and Euanthes
(blooming), and their marriage was annually celebrated by a
festival. Having compelled all the world to recognize his
divinity, he descended to the underworld to bring up his mother,
who was afterwards worshipped with him under the name of
Thyone (&ldquo;the raging&rdquo;), he himself being called after her
Thyoneus.</p>

<p>Another phase in the myth of Dionysus originated in observing
the decay of vegetation in winter, to suit which he was supposed
to be slain and to join the deities of the lower world. This phase
of his character was developed by the Orphic poets, he having
here the name of Zagreus (&ldquo;torn in pieces&rdquo;), and being no longer
the Theban god, but a son of Zeus and Persephone. The child
was brought up secretly, watched over by Curetes; but the
jealous Hera discovered where he was, and sent Titans to the spot,
who, finding him at play, tore him to pieces, and cooked and ate
his limbs, while Hera gave his heart to Zeus. The tearing in
pieces is referred by some to the torture experienced by the grape
(<i>Naturschmerz</i>) when crushed for making into wine (cf. Burns&rsquo;s
<i>John Barleycorn</i>); but it is better to refer it to the tearing of the
flesh of the victim at sacrifices at which the deity or the sacred
animal was slain, and sacramentally eaten raw (cf. the title
<span class="grk" title="Ã´mÃªstÃªs">&#8032;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#962;</span> given to Dionysus in certain places, probably pointing
to human sacrifice.) To connect this with the myth of the
Theban birth of Dionysus, it is said that Zeus gave the child&rsquo;s
heart to Semele, or himself swallowed it and gave birth to the new
Dionysus (called Iacchus from his worshippers&rsquo; cry of rejoicing),
who was cradled and swung in a winnowing fan (<span class="grk" title="liknos">&#955;&#943;&#954;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>; see
J. E. Harrison, <i>Journ. Hellenic Studies</i>, xxiii.), the swinging being
supposed to act as a charm in awakening vegetation from its
winter sleep. The conception of Zagreus, or the winter Dionysus,
appears to have originated in Crete, but it was accepted also in
Delphi, where his grave was shown, and sacrifice was secretly
offered at it annually on the shortest day. The story is in many
respects similar to that of Osiris. According to others, Zagreus
was originally a god of the chase, who became a hunter of men
and a god of the underworld, more akin to Hades than to
Dionysus (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Titans</a></span>).</p>

<p>Dionysus further possessed the prophetic gift, and his oracle
at Delphi was as important as that of Apollo. Like Hermes,
Dionysus was a god of the productiveness of nature, and hence
Priapus was one of his regular companions, while not only in the
mysteries but in the rural festivals his symbol, the phallus, was
carried about ostentatiously. His symbols from the animal
kingdom were the bull (perhaps a totemistic attribute and
identified with him), the panther, the lion, the tiger, the ass, the
goat, and sometimes also the dolphin and the snake. His personal
attributes are an ivy wreath, the thyrsus (a staff with pine cone at
the end), the laurel, the pine, a drinking cup, and sometimes the
horn of a bull on his forehead. Artistically he was represented
mostly either as a youth of soft, nearly feminine form, or as a
bearded and draped man, but frequently also as an infant, with
reference to his birth or to his bringing up in &ldquo;Nysa.&rdquo; His
earliest images were of wood with the branches still attached in
parts, whence he was called Dionysus Dendrites, an allusion to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
protection of trees generally (according to Pherecydes in C. W.
MÃ¼ller, <i>Frag. Hist. Graec.</i> iv. p. 637, the word <span class="grk" title="nysa">&#957;&#8166;&#963;&#945;</span> signified
&ldquo;tree&rdquo;). It is suggested that the cult of Dionysus absorbed that
of an old tree-spirit. He was figured also, like Hermes, in the
form of a pillar or term surmounted by his head. For the
connexion of Dionysus with Greek tragedy see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Drama</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIOPHANTUS,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> of Alexandria, Greek algebraist, probably
flourished about the middle of the 3rd century. Not that this
date rests on positive evidence. But it seems a fair inference from
a passage of Michael Psellus (<i>Diophantus</i>, ed. P. Tannery, ii.
p. 38) that he was not later than Anatolius, bishop of Laodicea
from <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 270, while he is not quoted by Nicomachus (fl. c.
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 100), nor by Theon of Smyrna (c. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 130), nor does Greek
arithmetic as represented by these authors and by Iamblichus
(end of 3rd century) show any trace of his influence, facts which
can only be accounted for by his being later than those arithmeticians
at least who would have been capable of understanding
him fully. On the other hand he is quoted by Theon of Alexandria
(who observed an eclipse at Alexandria in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 365); and his
work was the subject of a commentary by Theon&rsquo;s daughter
Hypatia (d. 415). The <i>Arithmetica</i>, the greatest treatise on which
the fame of Diophantus rests, purports to be in thirteen Books,
but none of the Greek MSS. which have survived contain more
than six (though one has the same text in seven Books). They
contain, however, a fragment of a separate tract on <i>Polygonal
Numbers</i>. The missing books were apparently lost early, for
there is no reason to suppose that the Arabs who translated or
commented on Diophantus ever had access to more of the work
than we now have. The difference in form and content suggests
that the <i>Polygonal Numbers</i> was not part of the larger work. On
the other hand the <i>Porisms</i>, to which Diophantus makes three
references (&ldquo;we have it in the Porisms that ...&rdquo;), were
probably not a separate book but were embodied in the
<i>Arithmetica</i> itself, whether placed all together or, as Tannery
thinks, spread over the work in appropriate places. The
&ldquo;Porisms&rdquo; quoted are interesting propositions in the theory of
numbers, one of which was clearly that <i>the difference between two
cubes can be resolved into the sum of two cubes</i>. Tannery thinks
that the solution of a complete quadratic promised by Diophantus
himself (I. def. 11), and really assumed later, was one of the
Porisms.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among the great variety of problems solved are problems leading
to determinate equations of the first degree in one, two, three or
four variables, to determinate quadratic equations, and to indeterminate
equations of the first degree in one or more variables, which
are, however, transformed into determinate equations by arbitrarily
assuming a value for one of the required numbers, Diophantus being
always satisfied with a rational, even if fractional, result and not requiring
a solution in integers. But the bulk of the work consists of
problems leading to indeterminate equations of the second degree,
and these universally take the form that one or two (and never
more) linear or quadratic functions of one variable x are to be made
rational square numbers by finding a suitable value for x. A few
problems lead to indeterminate equations of the third and fourth
degrees, an easy indeterminate equation of the sixth degree being
also found. The general type of problem is to find two, three or four
numbers such that different expressions involving them in the first
and second, and sometimes the third, degree are squares, cubes,
partly squares and partly cubes, &amp;c. E.g. <i>To find three numbers such
that the product of any two added to the sum of those two gives a square</i>
(III. 15, ed. Tannery); <i>To find four numbers such that, if we take the
square of their sum Â± any one of them singly, all the resulting numbers are
squares</i> (III. 22); <i>To find two numbers such that their product Â± their
sum gives a cube</i> (IV. 29); <i>To find three squares such that their continued
product added to any one of them gives a square</i> (V. 21). Book VI.
contains problems of finding rational <i>right-angled triangles</i> such that
different functions of their parts (the sides and the area) are squares.
A word is necessary on Diophantus&rsquo; notation. He has only one
symbol (written somewhat like a final sigma) for an unknown
quantity, which he calls <span class="grk" title="arithmos">&#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span> (defined as &ldquo;an undefined number of
units&rdquo;); the symbol may be a contraction of the initial letters &alpha;&rho;, as
&Delta;<span class="sp">&Upsilon;</span>, &Kappa;<span class="sp">&Upsilon;</span>, &Delta;<span class="sp">&Upsilon;</span>&Delta;, &amp;c.,
are for the powers of the unknown (<span class="grk" title="dynamis">&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;</span>, square;
<span class="grk" title="kubos">&#954;&#973;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span>, cube; <span class="grk" title="dynamodynamis">&#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;</span>, fourth power, &amp;c.). The only other
algebraical symbol is <img style="width:16px; height:12px" src="images/img288.jpg" alt="" /> for minus; plus being expressed by merely
writing terms one after another. With one symbol for an unknown,
it will easily be understood what scope there is for adroit assumptions,
for the required numbers, of expressions in the one unknown which
are at once seen to satisfy some of the conditions, leaving only one or
two to be satisfied by the particular value of x to be determined.
Often assumptions are made which lead to equations in x which
cannot be solved &ldquo;rationally,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> would give negative, surd or
imaginary values; Diophantus then traces how each element of the
equation has arisen, and formulates the auxiliary problem of determining
how the assumptions must be corrected so as to lead to an
equation (in place of the &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; one) which can be solved
rationally. Sometimes his x has to do duty twice, for different
unknowns, in one problem. In general his object is to reduce the
final equation to a simple one by making such an assumption for the
side of the square or cube to which the expression in x is to be equal
as will make the necessary number of coefficients vanish. The book
is valuable also for the propositions in the theory of numbers, other
than the &ldquo;porisms,&rdquo; stated or assumed in it. Thus Diophantus knew
that <i>no number of the form 8n + 7 can be the sum of three squares</i>. He
also says that, if 2n + 1 is to be the sum of two squares, &ldquo;n must not
be odd&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> <i>no number of the form 4n + 3, or 4n &minus; 1, can be the sum of
two squares</i>), and goes on to add, practically, the condition stated by
Fermat, &ldquo;and the double of it [n] increased by one, when divided
by the greatest square which measures it, must not be divisible by a
prime number of the form 4n &minus; 1,&rdquo; except for the omission of the
words &ldquo;when divided ... measures it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Authorities.</span>&mdash;The first to publish anything on Diophantus in
Europe was Rafael Bombelli, who embodied in his Algebra (1572)
all the problems of Books I.-IV. and some of Book V. interspersing
them with his own problems. Next Xylander (Wilhelm Holzmann)
published a Latin translation (Basel, 1575), an altogether meritorious
work, especially having regard to the difficulties he had with
the text of his MS. The Greek text was first edited by C. G. Bachet
(<i>Diophanti Alexandrini arithmeticorum libri sex, et de numeris
multangulis liber unus, nunc primum graece et latine editi atque
absolutissimis commentariis illustrati</i> ... Lutetiae Parisiorum ...
MDCXXI.). A reprint of 1670 is only valuable because it contains
P. de Fermat&rsquo;s notes; as far as the Greek text is concerned it is much
inferior to the other. There are two German translations, one by
Otto Schulz (1822) and the other by G. Wertheim (Leipzig, 1890),
and an English edition in modern notation (T. L. Heath, <i>Diophantos
of Alexandria: A Study in the History of Greek Algebra</i> (Cambridge,
1885)). The Greek text has now been definitively edited (with Latin
translation, Scholia, &amp;c.) by P. Tannery (Teubner, vol. i., 1893;
vol. ii., 1895). General accounts of Diophantus&rsquo; work are to be
found in H. Hankel and M. Cantor&rsquo;s histories of mathematics, and
more elaborate analyses are those of Nesselmann (<i>Die Algebra der
Griechen</i>, Berlin, 1842) and G. Loria (<i>Le Scienze esatte nell&rsquo; antica
Grecia</i>, libro v., Modena, 1902, pp. 95-158).</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIOPSIDE,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> an important member of the pyroxene group of
rock-forming minerals. It is a calcium-magnesium metasilicate,
CaMg(SiO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, and crystallizes in the monoclinic system. Usually
some iron is present replacing magnesium, and when this predominates
there is a passage to hedenbergite, CaFe(SiO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, a
closely allied variety of monoclinic pyroxene. These are distinguished
from augite by containing little or no aluminium.
Diopside is colourless, white, pale green to dark green or nearly
black in colour, the depth of the colour depending on the amount
of iron present. The specific gravity and optical constants also
vary with the chemical composition; the sp. gr. of diopside is
3.2, increasing to 3.6 in hedenbergite, and the angle of optical
extinction in the plane of symmetry varies between 38Â° and 47Â°
in the two extremes of the series. Crystals are usually prismatic
in habit with a rectangular cross-section as shown in the figure:
the angle between the prism faces m, parallel to which there are
perfect cleavages, is 92Â° 50&prime;.</p>

<p>Several varieties, depending on differences in structure and
chemical composition, have been distinguished, viz. coccolite
(from <span class="grk" title="kokkos">&#954;&#972;&#954;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, a grain), a granular variety;
salite or sahlite, from Sala in Sweden;
malacolite; diallage; violane, a lamellar
variety of a dark violet-blue colour;
chrome-diopside, a bright green variety
containing a small amount of chromium;
and many others. Belonging to the same
series with diopside and hedenbergite
is a manganese pyroxene, known as
schefierite, which has the composition
(Ca, Mg) (Fe, Mn) (Si0<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>.</p>

<p>Diopside is the characteristic pyroxene
of metamorphic rocks, occurring especially
in crystalline limestones, and often in
association with garnet and epidote. It
is also an essential constituent of some
pyroxene-granites, diorites and a few other igneous rocks, but
the characteristic pyroxene of this class of rocks is augite.
Fine transparent crystals of a pale green colour occur, with
crystals of yellowish-red garnet (hessonite) and chlorite, in veins
traversing serpentine in the Ala valley near Turin in Piedmont:
a crystal of this variety (&ldquo;alalite&rdquo;) is represented in the
accompanying figure. These, as well as the long, transparent,
bottle-green crystals from the Zillerthal in the Tyrol, have
occasionally been cut as gem-stones. Good crystals have been
found also at Achmatovsk near Zlatoust in the Urals, Traversella
near Ivrea in Piedmont (&ldquo;traversellite&rdquo;), Nordmark in Sweden,
Monroe in New York, Burgess in Lanark county, Ontario, and
several other places: at Nordmark the large, rectangular black
crystals occur with magnetite in the iron mines.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIOPTASE,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> a rare mineral species consisting of acid copper
orthosilicate, H<span class="su">2</span>CuSiO<span class="su">4</span>, crystallizing in the parallel-faced hemihedral
class of the rhombohedral system. The degree of symmetry
is the same as in the mineral phenacite,
there being only an axis of triad symmetry
and a centre of symmetry. The crystals
have the form of a hexagonal prism m
terminated by a rhombohedron r, the alternate
edges between these being sometimes replaced
by the faces of a rhombohedron s. The
faces are striated parallel to the edges between
r, s and m. There are perfect cleavages
parallel to the faces of a rhombohedron which
truncate the polar edges of r: from the cleavage
cracks internal reflections are often to
be seen in the crystal, and it was on account
of this that the mineral was named dioptase, by
R. J. HaÃ¼y in 1797, from <span class="grk" title="diopteuein">&#948;&#953;&#959;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, &ldquo;to see into.&rdquo; The crystals
vary from transparent to translucent with a vitreous lustre, and
are bright emerald-green in colour; they thus have a certain
resemblance to emerald, hence the early name emerald-copper
(German, <i>Kupfer-Smaragd</i>). Hardness 5; sp. gr. 3.3. The
mineral is decomposed by hydrochloric acid with separation of
gelatinous silica. At a red heat it blackens and gives off water.
The fine crystals from Mount Altyn-TÃ¼be on the western slopes of
the Altai Mountains in the Kirghiz Steppes, Asiatic Russia, line
cavities in a compact limestone; they were first sent to Europe
in 1785 by Achir Mahmed, a Bucharian merchant, after whom
the mineral has been named archirite. More recently, in 1890,
good crystals of similar habit, but rather darker in colour,
have been found with quartz and malachite near Komba in the
French Congo. As drusy crystalline crusts it has been found at
Copiapo in Chile and in Arizona.</p>

<p>Dioptase has occasionally been used as a gem-stone, especially
in Russia and Persia; it has a fine colour, but a low degree of
hardness and the transparency is imperfect.</p>

<span class="grk" title="dia">&#948;&#953;&#940;</span> through, <span class="grk" title="oros">&#8005;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, a boundary), in petrology, the name given
by HaÃ¼y to a family of rocks of granitic texture, composed of
plagioclase felspar and hornblende. As they are richer in the dark
coloured ferromagnesian minerals they are usually grey or dark
grey, and have a higher specific gravity than granite. They also
rarely show visible quartz. But there are diorites of many kinds,
as the name applies rather to a family of rocks than to a single
species. Some contain biotite, others augite or hypersthene;
many have a small amount of quartz. Orthoclase is rarely
entirely absent, and when it is fairly common the rock becomes a
tonalite; in this way a transition is furnished between diorites
and granites. It is rare to find the pure types of &ldquo;hornblende-diorite,&rdquo;
&ldquo;augite-diorite,&rdquo; &amp;c., but in most cases the rocks
contain two or more ferromagnesian silicates, and such combinations
as &ldquo;hornblende-biotite-diorite&rdquo; are commonest in nature.</p>

<p>The felspar of the diorites ranges in composition from oligoclase
to labradorite, and is often remarkably zonal, the external layers
being more alkaline than the internal. Small fluid enclosures
and black grains, probably iron oxides, often occur in it in great
numbers. Weathering produces epidote, calcite, sericite and
kaolin. The biotite is always brown or yellow; the hornblende
usually green, but sometimes brown or yellowish brown in those
diorites which have affinities to lamprophyres. The augite is
nearly always green but sometimes has a reddish tinge; bronzite
and hypersthene have their usual green and brown shades.
Apatite, iron oxides and zircon are almost invariably present;
sphene, garnet and orthite are occasionally observed; calcite,
chlorite, muscovite, kaolin, epidote and bastite are secondary.
The structure is not essentially different from that of granite.
The ferromagnesian minerals crystallize comparatively early
and have some idiomorphism; the felspar usually follows and
only in part shows good crystalline outlines. Orthoclase and
quartz, if present, are last to separate out, and fill the spaces
between the other minerals; often they interpenetrate to form
micropegmatite. In many diorites the plagioclase felspar has
crystallized before the hornblende, which consequently has less
perfect outlines and forms irregular plates which enclose sharply
formed individuals of felspar. This produces the ophitic structure
(very common also in the dolerites). More rarely biotite and
augite exhibit the same relations to the plagioclase. Orbicular
structure also occasionally appears in these rocks; in fact
the orbicular diorite of Corsica (also called &ldquo;Napoleonite&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Corsite&rdquo;) was for a long time the best-known example of this
structure. The rock seems composed of spheroids, about an inch
in diameter, surrounded by a smaller amount of dark-coloured
dioritic matrix. The spheroids have a radiate structure and often
show concentric dark and pale shells. These consist of hornblende
(dark green) and basic plagioclase felspar, labradorite and
bytownite (grey or nearly white). Occasionally diorites have
a parallel banded or foliated structure, but these must not be
confounded with the epidiorites, which are metamorphic rocks
and also have a conspicuous foliation.</p>

<p>Diorites must also be distinguished from hornblendic gabbros,
which contain more basic felspars, rarely quartz and occasionally
olivine; but the boundary lines between diorites and gabbros are
admittedly somewhat vague, <i>e.g.</i> some authors would call rocks
gabbro which others would regard as augite-diorite. The hornblendites
differ from the diorites in containing little felspar, and
consist principally of hornblende. Among varietal designations
given to rocks of the diorite family are &ldquo;banatite&rdquo; for an augite-diorite
with or without quartz (from the Schemnitz district),
&ldquo;granodiorite&rdquo; for a quartz-hornblende-diorite (essentially
the same as tonalite) from California, &amp;c., &ldquo;adamellite&rdquo; for
the quartz-mica-diorite or tonalite of Monte Adamello (Alps),
&ldquo;ornite&rdquo; for a hornblende-diorite rich in felspar, from Sweden.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIPHILUS<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span>, of Sinope, poet of the new Attic comedy and
contemporary of Menander (342-291 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>). Most of his plays were
written and acted at Athens, but he led a wandering life, and died
at Smyrna. He was on intimate terms with the famous courtesan
Gnathaena (Athenaeus xiii. pp. 579, 583). He is said to have
written 100 comedies, the titles of fifty of which are preserved.
He sometimes acted himself. To judge from the imitations
of Plautus. (<i>Casina</i> from the <span class="grk" title="KlÃªroumenoi">&#922;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span>, <i>Asinaria</i> from the
<span class="grk" title="Onagos">&#908;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#972;&#962;</span>, <i>Rudens</i> from some other play), he was very skilful in
the construction of his plots. Terence also tells us that he
introduced into the <i>Adelphi</i> (ii. 1) a scene from the <span class="grk" title="SynapothnÃªskontes">&#931;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span>,
which had been omitted by Plautus in his adaptation
(<i>Commorientes</i>) of the same play. The style of Diphilus was
simple and natural, and his language on the whole good Attic;
he paid great attention to versification, and was supposed to have
invented a peculiar kind of metre. The ancients were undecided
whether to class him among the writers of the New or Middle
comedy. In his fondness for mythological subjects (<i>Hercules</i>,
<i>Theseus</i>) and his introduction on the stage (by a bold anachronism)
of the poets Archilochus and Hipponax as rivals of
Sappho, he approximates to the spirit of the latter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIPHTHERIA<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (from <span class="grk" title="diphthera">&#948;&#953;&#966;&#952;&#941;&#961;&#945;</span>, a skin or membrane), the term
applied to an acute infectious disease, which is accompanied by
a membranous exudation on a mucous surface, generally on the
tonsils and back of the throat or pharynx.</p>

<p>In general the symptoms at the commencement of an attack
of diphtheria are comparatively slight, being those commonly
accompanying a cold, viz. chilliness and depression. Sometimes
more severe phenomena usher in the attack, such as vomiting
and diarrhoea. A slight feeling of uneasiness in the throat is experienced
along with some stiffness of the back of the neck. When
looked at the throat appears reddened and somewhat swollen,
particularly in the neighbourhood of the tonsils, the soft palate
and upper part of pharynx, while along with this there is tenderness
and swelling of the glands at the angles of the jaws. The
affection of the throat spreads rapidly, and soon the characteristic
exudation appears on the inflamed surface in the form of
greyish-white specks or patches, increasing in extent and thickness
until a yellowish-looking false membrane is formed. This deposit
is firmly adherent to the mucous membrane beneath or incorporated
with it, and if removed leaves a raw, bleeding,
ulcerated surface, upon which it is reproduced in a short period.
The appearance of the exudation has been compared to wet
parchment or washed leather, and it is more or less dense in
texture. It may cover the whole of the back of the throat, the
cavity of the mouth, and the posterior nares, and spread downwards
into the air-passages on the one hand and into the alimentary
canal on the other, while any wound on the surface of
the body is liable to become covered with it. This membrane is
apt to be detached spontaneously, and as it loosens it becomes
decomposed, giving a most offensive and characteristic odour to
the breath. There is pain and difficulty in swallowing, but unless
the disease has affected the larynx no affection of the breathing.
The voice acquires a snuffling character. When the disease
invades the posterior nares an acrid, fetid discharge, and sometimes
also copious bleeding, takes place from the nostrils. Along
with these local phenomena there is evidence of constitutional
disturbance of the most severe character. There may be no
great amount of fever, but there is marked depression and loss of
strength. The pulse becomes small and frequent, the countenance
pale, the swelling of the glands of the neck increases, which, along
with the presence of albumen in the urine, testifies to a condition
of blood poisoning. Unless favourable symptoms emerge death
takes place within three or four days or sooner, either from the
rapid extension of the false membrane into the air-passage, giving
rise to asphyxia, or from a condition of general collapse, which is
sometimes remarkably sudden. In cases of recovery the change
for the better is marked by an arrest in the extension of the false
membrane, the detachment and expectoration of that already
formed, and the healing of the ulcerated mucous membrane
beneath. Along with this there is a general improvement in the
symptoms, the power of swallowing returns, and the strength
gradually increases, while the glandular enlargement of the
neck diminishes, and the albumen disappears from the urine.
Recovery, however, is generally slow, and it is many weeks
before full convalescence is established. Even, however, where
diphtheria ends thus favourably, the peculiar sequelae already
mentioned are apt to follow, generally within a period of two or
three weeks after all the local evidence of the disease has disappeared.
These secondary affections may occur after mild as
well as after severe attacks, and they are principally in the form of
paralysis affecting the soft palate and pharynx, causing difficulty
in swallowing with regurgitation of food through the nose, and
giving a peculiar nasal character to the voice. There are, however,
other forms of paralysis occurring after diphtheria, especially
that affecting the muscles of the eye, which produces a loss of the
power of accommodation and consequent impairment of vision.
There may be, besides, paralysis of both legs, and occasionally
also of one side of the body (hemiplegia). These symptoms,
however, after continuing for a variable length of time, almost
always ultimately disappear.</p>

<p>Under the name of the <i>Malum Egyptiacum</i>, Aretaeus in the 2nd
century gives a minute description of a disease which in all its
essential characteristics corresponds to diphtheria. In the 16th,
17th and 18th centuries epidemics of diphtheria appear to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
frequently prevailed in many parts of Europe, particularly in
Holland, Spain, Italy, France, as well as in England, and were
described by physicians belonging to those countries under various
titles; but it is probable that other diseases of a similar nature
were included in their descriptions, and no accurate account of
this affection had been published till M. Bretonneau of Tours in
1821 laid his celebrated treatise on the subject before the French
Academy of Medicine. By him the term <i>La DiphthÃ©rite</i> was first
given to the disease.</p>

<p>Great attention has been paid to diphtheria in recent years,
with some striking results. Its cause and nature have been
definitely ascertained, the conditions which influence its prevalence
have been elucidated, and a specific &ldquo;cure&rdquo; has been
found. In the last respect it occupies a unique position at the
present time. In the case of several other zymotic diseases much
has been done by way of prevention, little or nothing for treatment;
in the case of diphtheria prevention has failed, but treatment
has been revolutionized by the introduction of antitoxin,
which constitutes the most important contribution to practical
medicine as yet made by bacteriology.</p>

<p>The exciting cause of diphtheria is a micro-organism, identified
by Klebs and Loffler in 1883 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parasitic Diseases</a></span>). It
has been shown by experiment that the symptoms of
diphtheria, including the after-effects, are produced by
<span class="sidenote">Causation.</span>
a toxin derived from the micro-organisms which lodge in the air-passages
and multiply in a susceptible subject. The natural
history of the organism outside the body is not well understood,
but there is some reason to believe that it lives in a dormant
condition in suitable soils. Recent research does not favour the
theory that it is derived from defective drains or &ldquo;sewer gas,&rdquo;
but these things, like damp and want of sunlight, probably
promote its spread, by lowering the health of persons exposed to
them, and particularly by causing an unhealthy condition of the
throat, rendering it susceptible to the contagion. Defective
drainage, or want of drainage, may also act, by polluting the
ground, and so providing a favourable soil for the germ, though
it is to be noted that &ldquo;the steady increase in the diphtheria
mortality has coincided, in point of time, with steady improvement
in regard of such sanitary circumstances as water supply,
sewerage, and drainage&rdquo; (Thorne Thorne). Cats and cows are
susceptible to the diphtheritic bacillus, and fowls, turkeys
and other birds have been known to suffer from a disease like
diphtheria, but other domestic animals appear to be more or less
resistant or immune. In human beings the mere presence of the
germ is not sufficient to cause disease; there must also be
susceptibility, but it is not known in what that consists. Individuals
exhibit all degrees of resistance up to complete immunity.
Children are far more susceptible than adults, but even children
may have the Klebs-Loffler bacillus in their throats without
showing any symptoms of illness. Altogether there are many
obscure points about this micro-organism, which is apt to assume
a puzzling variety of forms. Nevertheless its identification has
greatly facilitated the diagnosis of the disease, which was previously
a very difficult matter, often determined in an arbitrary
fashion on no particular principles.</p>

<p>Diphtheria, as at present understood, may be defined as sore
throat in which the bacillus is found; if it cannot be found, the
illness is regarded as something else, unless the clinical symptoms
are quite unmistakable. One result of this is a large transference
of registered mortality from other throat affections, and particularly
from croup, to diphtheria. Croup, which never had a well-defined
application, and is not recognized by the College of
Physicians as a synonym for diphtheria, appears to be dying out
from the medical vocabulary in Great Britain. In France the
distinction has never been recognized.</p>

<p>Diphtheria is endemic in all European and American countries,
and is apparently increasing, but the incidence varies greatly.
It is far more prevalent on the continent than in
England, and still more so in the United States and
<span class="sidenote">Prevalence.</span>
Canada. The following table, compiled from figures
collected by Dr Newsholme, shows how London compares with
some foreign cities. The figures give the mean death-rate from
diphtheria and croup for the term of years during which records
have been kept. The period varies in different cases, and therefore
the comparison is only a rough one.</p>

<p>There is comparatively little diphtheria in India and Japan,
but in Egypt, the Cape and Australasia it prevails very extensively
among the urban populations. The mortality varies greatly from
year to year in all countries and cities. In Berlin, for instance, it
has oscillated between a maximum of 2420 in 1883 and a minimum
of 340 in 1896; in New York between 2760 in 1877 and 680 in
1868; in Christiania between 3290 in 1887 and 170 in 1871. In
some American cities still higher maxima have been recorded. In
other words, diphtheria, though always endemic, exhibits at times
a great increase of activity, and becomes epidemic or even
pandemic. The following table for 1859-99 shows fairly well the
periodical rise and fall in England and Wales. Diphtheria and
croup are given both separately and together, showing the
increasing transference from one to the other of late years.
Diphtheria was first entered separately in the year 1859.</p>

<p>Several facts are roughly indicated by the table. It begins
with an extremely severe epidemic, which has not been approached
since. Then follows a fall extending over twenty years.
On the whole this diminution was progressive, though not in
reality so steady as the decennial grouping makes it appear, being
interrupted by smaller oscillations in single years and groups of
years. Still the main fact holds good. After 1880 an opposite
movement began, likewise interrupted by minor oscillations, but
on the whole progressive, and culminating in the year 1893 with a
death-rate of 389, the highest recorded since 1865. After 1896
a marked fall again took place. This is partly accounted for by
the use of antitoxin, which only began on a considerable scale in
1895, and did not become general until a year or two later at
least. Its effects were only then fully felt. The registrar-general&rsquo;s
returns record mortality, not prevalence&mdash;that is to
say, the number of deaths, not of cases.</p>

<p>On the whole, we get clear evidence of an epidemic rise and fall,
which may serve to dispose of some erroneous conceptions. The
belief, held until recently, that diphtheria is steadily increasing in
Great Britain was obviously premature; it did rise over a series
of years, but has now ebbed again. Moreover, the general
prevalence during the last thirty years has been notably less
than in the previous twelve years. Yet it is during years since
1870 that compulsory education has been in existence and
main drainage chiefly carried out. It follows that neither school
attendance nor sewer gas exercises such an important influence
over the epidemicity of diphtheria as some other conditions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
What are those conditions? Dr Newsholme has advanced the
theory, based on an elaborate examination of statistics in various
countries, that the activity of diphtheria is connected with the
rainfall, and he lays down the following general induction from
the facts: &ldquo;Diphtheria only becomes epidemic in years in which
the rainfall is deficient, and the epidemics are on the largest scale
when three or more years of deficient rainfall follow each other.&rdquo;
He points out that the comparative rarity of diphtheria in tropical
climates, which are characterized by excessive rainfall, and its
greater prevalence in continental than in insular countries,
confirm his theory. His observations seem quite contrary to the
view laid down by various authorities, and hitherto accepted,
that wet weather favours diphtheria. The two, however, are not
irreconcilable. The key to the problem&mdash;and possibly to many
other epidemiological problems&mdash;may perhaps be found in the
movements of the subsoil water. It has been suggested by
different observers, and particularly by Mr M. A. Adams, who has
for some years made a study of the subsoil water at Maidstone,
that there is a definite connexion between it and diphtheria. In
England the underground water normally reaches its lowest level
at the end of the summer; then it gradually rises, fed by percolation
from the winter rains, reaching a maximum level about the
end of March, after which it gradually sinks. This maximum
level Mr Adams calls the annual spring cleaning of the soil, and
his observations go to show that when the normal movement is
arrested or disturbed, diphtheria becomes active. Now that is
what happens in periods of drought. The underground water
does not rise to its usual level, and there is no spring cleaning.
The hypothesis, then, is this: The diphtheria bacillus lives in the
soil, but is &ldquo;drowned out&rdquo; in wet periods by the subsoil water.
In droughty ones it lives and flourishes in the warm, dry soil;
then when rain comes, it is driven out with the ground air into the
houses. This process will continue for some time, so that epidemic
outbreaks may well seem to be associated with wet. But they
begin in drought, and are stopped by long-continued periods of
copious rainfall. This is quite in keeping with the observed fact
that diphtheria is a seasonal disease, always most prevalent in the
last quarter of the year. The summer develops the poison in the
soil, the autumnal rains bring it out. The fact that the same
cause does not produce the same effect in tropical countries may
perhaps be explained by the extreme violence of the alternations,
which are too great to suit this particular micro-organism, or
possibly the regularity of the rainfall prevents its development.</p>

<p>The foregoing hypothesis is supported by a good deal of
evidence, and notably by the concurrence of the great epidemic
or pandemic prevalence in Great Britain, culminating in 1859,
with a prolonged period of exceptionally deficient rainfall. Again,
the highest death-rate registered since 1865 was in 1893, a year
of similarly exceptional drought. But it is no more than an
hypothesis, and the fate of former theories is a warning against
drawing conclusions from statistics and records extending over
too short a period of time. The warning is particularly necessary
in connexion with meteorological conditions, which are apt to
upset all calculations. As it happens, a period of deficient rainfall
even greater than that of 1854-1858 has recently been
experienced. It began in 1893 and culminated in the extraordinary
season of 1899. The dry years were 1893, 1895, 1896,
1898 and 1899, and the deficiency of rainfall was not made good
by any considerable excess in 1894 and 1897. It surpassed all
records at Greenwich; streams and wells ran dry all over the
country, and the flow of the Thames and Lea was reduced to
the lowest point ever recorded. There should be, according to
the theory, at least a very large increase in the prevalence of
diphtheria. To a certain extent it has held good. There was a
marked rise in 1893-1896 over the preceding period, though not
so large as might have been expected, but it was followed by a
decided fall in 1897-1898. The experience of 1898 contradicts,
that of 1899 supports, the theory. Further light is therefore
required; but perhaps the failure of the recent drought to produce
results at all comparable with the epidemic of the &rsquo;fifties may be
due to variations in the resistance of the disease, which differs
widely in different years. It may also be due in part to improved
sanitation, to the notification of infectious diseases, the use of
isolation hospitals, which have greatly developed in quite recent
years, and, lastly, to the beneficial effects of antitoxin. If these
be the real explanations, then scientific and administrative work
has not been thrown away after all in combating this very painful
and fatal enemy of the young.</p>

<p>The conditions governing the general prevalence of diphtheria,
and its epidemic rise and fall, which have just been discussed, do
not touch the question of actual dissemination. The
contagion is spread by means which are in constant
<span class="sidenote">Dissemination.</span>
operation, whether the general amount of disease is
great or small. Water, so important in some epidemic diseases,
is believed not to be one of them, though a negative proof based
on absence of evidence cannot be accepted as conclusive. On
the other hand, milk is undoubtedly a means of dissemination.
Several outbreaks of an almost explosive character, besides minor
extensions of disease from one place to another, have been traced
to this cause. Milk may be contaminated in various ways&mdash;at
the dairy, for instance, or on the way to customers,&mdash;but several
cases, investigated by the officers of the Local Government Board
and others, have been thought to point to infection from cows
suffering from a diphtheritic affection of the udder. The part
played by aÃ«rial convection is undetermined, but there is no
reason to suppose that the infecting material is conveyed any
distance by wind or air currents. Instances which seem to point
to the contrary may be explained in other ways, and particularly
by the fact, now fully demonstrated, that persons suffering from
minor sore throats, not recognized as diphtheria, may carry the
disease about and introduce it into other localities. Human
intercourse is the most important means of dissemination, the
contagion passing from person to person either by actual contact,
as in kissing, or by the use of the same utensils and articles, or by
mere proximity. In the last case the germs must be supposed to
be air-borne for short distances, and to enter with the breath.
Rooms appear liable to become infected by the presence of
diphtheritic cases, and so spread the disease among other persons
using them. At a small outbreak which occurred at Darenth
Asylum in 1898 the infection clung obstinately to a particular
ward, in spite of the prompt removal of all cases, and fresh ones
continued to occur until it had been thoroughly disinfected, after
which there were no more. The part played by human intercourse
in fostering the spread of the disease suggests that it would
naturally be more prevalent in urban communities, where people
congregate together more, than in rural ones. This is at variance
with the conclusion laid down by some authorities, that in this
country diphtheria used to affect chiefly the sparsely populated
districts, and though tending to become more urban, is still
rather a rural disease. That view is based upon an analysis of the
distribution by counties in England and Wales from 1855 to 1880,
and it has been generally accepted and repeated until it has
become a sort of axiom. Of course the facts of distribution are
facts, but the general inference drawn from them, that diphtheria
peculiarly affects the country and is changing its <i>habitat</i>, may be
erroneous. Dr Newsholme, by taking a wider basis of experience,
has arrived at the opposite conclusion, and finds that diphtheria
does not, in fact, flourish more in sparsely-peopled districts.
&ldquo;When a sufficiently long series of years is taken,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it
appears clear that there is more diphtheria in urban than in rural
communities.&rdquo; The rate for London has always been in excess of
that for the whole of England and Wales. Its distribution at any
given time is determined by a number of circumstances, and by
their incidental co-operation, not by any property or predilection
for town or country inherent in the disease. There are the
epidemic conditions of soil and rainfall, previously discussed,
which vary widely in different localities at different times; there
is the steady influence of regular intercourse, and the accidental
element of special distribution by various means. These things
may combine to alter the incidence. In short, accident plays
too great a part to permit any general conclusion to be drawn
from distribution, except from a very wide basis of experience.
The variations are very great and sometimes very sudden. For
instance, the county of London for some years headed the list,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
having a far higher death-rate than any other. In 1898 it dropped
to the fifth place, and was surpassed by Rutland, a purely rural
county, which had the lowest mortality of all in the previous year
and very nearly the lowest for the previous ten years. Again,
South Wales, which had had a low mortality for some years,
suddenly came into prominence as a diphtheria district, and in
1898 had the highest death-rate in the country. Staffordshire
and Bedfordshire show a similar rise, the one an urban, the other
a rural, county. All the northern counties, both rural and urban,&mdash;namely,
Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland, Westmorland,
Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cheshire and Lincolnshire,&mdash;had a very
high rate in 1861-1870, and a low one in 1896-1898. It is
obviously unsafe to draw general conclusions from distribution
data on a small scale. Diphtheria appears to creep about very
slowly, as a rule, from place to place, and from one part of a large
town to another; it forsakes one district and appears in another;
occasionally it attacks a fresh locality with great energy, presumably
because the local conditions are exceptionally favourable,
which may be due to the soil or, possibly, to the susceptibility of
the inhabitants, who are, so to speak, virgin ground. But through
it all personal infection is the chief means of spread.</p>

<p>The acceptance of this doctrine has directed great attention to
the practical question of school influence. There is no doubt
whatever that it plays a very considerable part in spreading
diphtheria. The incidence of the disease is chiefly on children,
and nothing so often and regularly brings large numbers together
in close contact under the same roof as school attendance.
Nothing, in fact, furnishes such constant and extensive opportunities
for personal infection. Many outbreaks have definitely
been traced to schools. In London the subject has been very
fully investigated by Sir Shirley Murphy, the medical officer of
health to the London County Council, and by Dr W. R. Smith,
formerly medical officer of health to the London School Board.
Sir Shirley Murphy has shown that a special incidence on children
of school age began to manifest itself after the adoption of
compulsory education, and that the summer holidays are marked
by a distinct diminution of cases, which is succeeded by an
increase on the return to school. Dr W. R. Smith&rsquo;s observations
are directed rather to minimizing the effect of school influence,
and to showing that it is less important than other factors;
which is doubtless true, as has been already remarked. It
appears that the heaviest incidence falls upon infants under school
age, and that liability diminishes progressively after school age
is reached. But this by no means disposes of the importance of
school influence, as the younger children at home may be infected
by older ones, who have picked up the contagion at school, but,
being less susceptible, are less severely affected and exhibit no
worse symptoms than a sore throat. From a practical point of
view the problem is a difficult one to deal with, as it is virtually
impossible to ensure the exclusion of all infection, on account
of the deceptively mild forms it may assume; but considering
how very often outbreaks of diphtheria necessitate the closing of
schools, it would probably be to the advantage of the authorities
to discourage, rather than to compel, the attendance of children
with sore throats. A fact of some interest revealed by statistics
is that in the earliest years of life the incidence of diphtheria is
greater upon male than upon female children, but from three
years onwards the position is reversed, and with every succeeding
year the relative female liability becomes greater. This is probably
due to the habit of kissing maintained among females, but
more and more abandoned by boys from babyhood onwards.</p>

<p>All these considerations suggest the importance of segregating
the sick in isolation hospitals. Of late years this preventive
measure has been carried out with increasing efficiency, owing to
the better provision of such hospitals and the greater willingness
of the public to make use of them; and probably the improvement
so effected has had some share in keeping down the
prevalence of the disease to comparatively moderate proportions.
Unfortunately, the complete segregation of infected persons is
hardly possible, because of the mild symptoms, and even absence
of symptoms, exhibited by some individuals. A further difficulty
arises with reference to the discharge of patients. It has been
proved that the bacillus may persist almost indefinitely in the
air-passages in certain cases, and in a considerable proportion it
does persist for several weeks after convalescence. On returning
home such cases may, and often do, infect others.</p>

<p>Since the antitoxin treatment was introduced in 1894 it has
overshadowed all other methods. We owe this drug originally
to the Berlin school of bacteriologists, and particularly
to Dr Behring. The idea of making use of serum arose
<span class="sidenote">Treatment.</span>
about 1890, out of researches made in connexion with Mechnikov&rsquo;s
theory of phagocytosis, by which is meant the action of the
phagocytes or white corpuscles of the blood in destroying the
bacteria of disease. It was shown by the German bacteriologists
that the serum or liquid part of the blood plays an equally or more
important part in resisting disease, and the idea of combating
the toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria with resistant serum
injected into the blood presented itself to several workers. The
idea was followed up and worked out independently in France and
Germany, so successfully that by the year 1894 the serum treatment
had been tried on a considerable scale with most encouraging
results. Some of these were published in Germany in the
earlier part of that year, and at the International Hygienic
Congress, held in Budapest a little later, Dr Roux, of the Institut
Pasteur, whose experience was somewhat more extensive than
that of his German colleagues, read a paper giving the result of
several hundred cases treated in Paris. When all allowance for
errors had been made, they showed a remarkable and even
astonishing reduction of mortality, fully confirming the conclusions
drawn from the German experiments. This consensus of
independent opinion proved a great stimulus to further trial, and
before long one <i>clinique</i> after another told the same tale. The
evidence was so favourable that Professor Virchow&mdash;the last man
to be carried away by a novelty&mdash;declared it &ldquo;the imperative
duty of medical men to use the new remedy&rdquo; (<i>The Times</i>, 19th
October 1894). Since then an enormous mass of facts has
accumulated from all quarters of the globe, all testifying to
the value of antitoxin in the treatment of diphtheria. The
experience of the hospitals of the London Metropolitan Asylums
Board for five years before and after antitoxin may be given
as a particularly instructive illustration; but the subsequent
reduction in the rate of mortality (12 in 1900, 11.3 in 1901,
10.8 in 1902, 9.3 in 1903, and an average of 9 in 1904-1908) added
further confirmation.</p>

<p>The number of cases dealt with in these five antitoxin years
was 32,835, or an average of 6567 a year, and the broad result
is a reduction of mortality by more than one-half. It is a
fair inference that the treatment saves the lives of about 1000
children every year in London alone. This refers to all cases.
Those which occur in the hospitals as a sequel to scarlet fever, and
consequently come under treatment from the commencement,
show very much more striking results. The case mortality, which
was 46.8% in 1892 and 58.8% in 1893, has been reduced to
3.6% since the introduction of antitoxin. But the evidence is
not from statistics alone. The beneficial effect of the treatment
is equally attested by clinical observation. Dr Roux&rsquo;s original
account has been confirmed by a cloud of witnesses year after
year. &ldquo;One may say,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;that the appearance of most
of the patients is totally different from what it used to be.
The pale and leaden faces are scarcely seen in the wards; the
expression of the children is brighter and more lively.&rdquo; Adult
patients have described the relief afforded by inoculation; it acts
like a charm, and lifts the deadly feeling of oppression off like
a cloud in the course of a few hours. Finally, the counteracting
effect of antitoxin in preventing the disintegrating action of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
diphtheritic toxin on
the nervous tissues has
been demonstrated
pathologically. There
are some who still affect
scepticism as to the
value of this drug.
They cannot be acquainted
with the evidence,
for if the efficacy
of antitoxin in the treatment
of diphtheria has
not been proved, then
neither can the efficacy
of any treatment for
anything be said to be
proved. Prophylactic
properties are also
claimed for the serum;
but protection is necessarily
more difficult to
demonstrate than cure,
and though there is
some evidence to support
the claim, it has
not been fully made
out.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIPLODOCUS,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> a
gigantic extinct land
reptile discovered in
rocks of Upper Jurassic
age in western North
America, the best-known
example of a
Sauropodous Dinosaur.
The first scattered remains
of a skeleton were
found in 1877 by Prof.
S.W. Williston near
CaÃ±on City, Colorado;
and the tail and hind-limb
of this specimen
were described in the
following year by Prof.
O.C. Marsh. He
noticed that in the part
of the tail which dragged
on the ground, each
chevron bone below the
vertebral column consisted
of a pair of bars;
and as so peculiar an
arrangement for the
protection of the artery
and vein beneath the
tail had not previously
been observed in any
animal, he proposed
the name <i>Diplodocus</i>
(&ldquo;double beam&rdquo; or
&ldquo;double bar&rdquo;) for the
new reptile, adding the
specific name <i>longus</i> in allusion to the elongated shape of the
tail vertebrae. In 1884 Prof. Marsh described the head,
vertebrae and pelvis of the same skeleton, which is now
in the National Museum, Washington. In 1897 the next
important specimen, a tail associated with other fragments,
apparently of <i>Diplodocus longus</i>, was obtained by the American
Museum of Natural History, New York, from Como Bluffs,
Wyoming. In 1899-1900 large parts of two skeletons of another
species, in a remarkable state of preservation, were disinterred
by Messrs J. L. Wortman, O. A. Peterson and J. B. Hatcher in
Sheep Creek, Albany county, Wyo., and these are now exhibited
with minor discoveries in the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburg. There
are also other specimens in New York, Chicago and the University
of Wyoming. In 1901 Mr J. B. Hatcher studied the new
species at Pittsburg, named it <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>, and published
the first restored sketch of a complete skeleton. Shortly afterwards
plaster casts of the finest specimens were prepared under
the direction of Mr J. B. Hatcher and Dr W. J. Holland, and
these were skilfully combined to form the cast of a completely
reconstructed skeleton, which was presented to the British
Museum by Andrew Carnegie in 1905. This reconstruction is
based primarily on a well-preserved chain of vertebrae, extending
from the second cervical to the twelfth caudal, associated with
the ribs, pelvis and several limb-bones. The tail is completed
from two other specimens in the Carnegie Museum, having caudals
13 to 36 and 37 to 73 respectively in apparently unbroken series.
Prof. Marsh&rsquo;s specimen in Washington supplied the greater part
of the skull; and the fore-foot is copied from a specimen in New
York.</p>

<p>The cast of the reconstructed skeleton of <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>
measures 84 ft. in length and 12 ft. 9 in. in maximum height at
the hind-limbs. It displays the elongated neck and tail and the
relatively small head so characteristic of the Sauropodous
Dinosaurs. The skull is inclined to the axis of the neck, denoting
a browsing animal; while the feeble blunt teeth and flat
expanded snout suggest feeding among succulent water-weeds.
The large narial opening at the highest point of the head probably
indicates an aquatic mode of life, and there seems to have
been a soft valve to close the nostrils when under water. The
diminutive brain-cavity, scarcely large enough to contain a
walnut, is noteworthy. There are 104 vertebrae, namely, 15 in
the neck, 11 in the back, 5 in the sacrum and 73 in the tail. The
presacral vertebrae are of remarkably light construction, the
plates and struts of bone being arranged to give the greatest
strength with the least weight. The end of the tail is a flexible
lash, which would probably be used as a weapon, like the tail of
some existing lizards. The feet, notwithstanding the weight they
had to support, are as unsymmetrical as those of a crocodile, with
claws only on the three inner toes. There is no external armour.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIPLOMACY<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (Fr. <i>diplomatie</i>), the art of conducting international
negotiations. The word, borrowed from the French, has
the same derivation as Diplomatic (<i>q.v.</i>), and, according to the
<i>New English Dictionary</i>, was first used in England so late as 1796
by Burke. Yet there is no other word in the English language
that could supply its exact sense. The need for such a term
was indeed not felt; for what we know as diplomacy was long
regarded, partly as falling under the <i>Jus gentium</i> or international
law, partly as a kind of activity morally somewhat suspect and
incapable of being brought under any system. Moreover, though
in a certain sense it is as old as history, diplomacy as a uniform
system, based upon generally recognized rules and directed by
a diplomatic hierarchy having a fixed international status, is of
quite modern growth even in Europe. It was finally established
only at the congresses of Vienna (1815) and Aix-la-Chapelle (1818),
while its effective extension to the great monarchies of the East,
beyond the bounds of European civilization, was comparatively
an affair of yesterday. So late as 1876 it was possible for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
writer on this subject in the 9th edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</i> to say that &ldquo;it would be an historical absurdity to
suppose diplomatic relations connecting together China, Burma
and Japan, as they connect the great European powers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Principles.</i>&mdash;Though diplomacy has been usually treated under
the head of international law, it would perhaps be more consonant
with the facts to place international law under diplomacy. The
principles and rules governing the intercourse of states, defined
by a long succession of international lawyers, have no sanction
save the consensus of the powers, established and maintained
by diplomacy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Balance of Power</a></span>); in so far as they have
become, by international agreement, more than mere pious
opinions of theorists, they are working rules established for
mutual convenience, which it is the function of diplomacy to
safeguard or to use for its own ends. In any case they by no
means cover the whole field of diplomatic activity; and, were
they swept away, the art of diplomacy, developed through long
ages of experience, would survive.</p>

<p>This experience may perhaps be called the science, as distinct
from the art, of diplomacy. It covers not only the province of
international law, but the vast field of recorded experience which
we know as history, of which indeed international law is but a
part; for, as Bielfeld in his <i>Institutions politiques</i> (La Haye, 1760,
t. I. ch. ii. Â§ 13) points out, &ldquo;public law is founded on facts. To
know it we must know history, which is the soul of this science
as of politics in general.&rdquo; The broad outlook on human affairs
implied in &ldquo;historical sense&rdquo; is more necessary to the diplomatist
under modern conditions than in the 18th century, when international
policy was still wholly under the control of princes
and their immediate advisers. Diplomacy was then a game of
wits played in a narrow circle. Its objects too were narrower;
for states were practically regarded as the property of their
sovereigns, which it was the main function of their &ldquo;agents&rdquo; to
enlarge or to protect, while scarcely less important than the
preservation or rearrangement of territorial boundaries was that
of precedence and etiquette generally, over which an incredible
amount of time was wasted. The <i>haute diplomatie</i> thus resolved
itself into a process of exalted haggling, conducted with an
utter disregard of the ordinary standards of morality, but with
the most exquisite politeness and in accordance with ever
more and more elaborate rules. Much of the outcome of these
dead debates has become stereotyped in the conventions of the
diplomatic service; but the character of diplomacy itself has
undergone a great change. This change is threefold: firstly, as
the result of the greater sense of the community of interests
among nations, which was one of the outcomes of the French
Revolution; secondly, owing to the rise of democracy, with its
expression in parliamentary assemblies and in the press; thirdly,
through the alteration in the position of the diplomatic agent, due
to modern means of communication.</p>

<p>The first of these changes may be dated to the circular of Count
Kaunitz of the 17th of July 1791, in which, in face of the Revolution,
he impressed upon the powers the duty of making common
cause for the purpose of preserving &ldquo;public peace, the tranquillity
of states, the inviolability of possessions, and the faith of
treaties.&rdquo; The duty of watching over the common interests of
Europe, or of the world, was thus for the first time officially
recognized as a function of diplomacy, since common action could
only be taken as the result of diplomatic negotiations. It would
be easy to exaggerate the effective results of this idea, even when
it had crystallized in the Grand Alliance of 1814 and been proclaimed
to the world in the Holy Alliance of the 26th of September
1815 and the declaration of Aix-la-Chapelle. The cynical picture
given by La BruyÃ¨re of the diplomatist of the 18th century still
remained largely true: &ldquo;His talk is only of peace, of alliances,
of the public tranquillity, and of the public interests; in reality
he is thinking only of his own, that is to say, of those of his master
or of his republic.&rdquo;<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The proceedings of the congress of Vienna
proved how little the common good weighed unless reinforced
by particular interests; but the conception of &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; as a
political entity none the less survived. The congresses, notably
the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (<i>q.v.</i>) in 1818, were in a certain
sense European parliaments, and their ostensible object was the
furtherance of common interests. Had the imperial dreamer
Alexander I. of Russia had his way, they would have been
permanently established on the broad basis of the Holy Alliance,
and would have included, not the great powers only, but representatives
of every state (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alexander I.</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Europe</a></span> :
<i>History</i>). Whatever the effective value of that &ldquo;Concert of
Europe&rdquo; which was the outcome of the period of the congresses,
it certainly produced a great effect on the spirit and the practice
of diplomacy. In the congresses and conferences diplomacy
assumes international functions both legislative and administrative.
The diplomat is responsible, not only to his own
government, but to &ldquo;Europe.&rdquo; Thus Castlereagh was accused of
subordinating the interests of Great Britain to those of Europe;
and the same charge was brought, perhaps with greater justice,
against Metternich in respect of Austria. Canning&rsquo;s principle of
&ldquo;Every nation for itself and God for us all!&rdquo; prevailed, it is
true, over that of Alexander&rsquo;s &ldquo;Confederation of Europe&rdquo;; yet,
as one outcome of the congresses, every diplomatic agent, though
he represents the interests of his own state, has behind him the
whole body of the treaties which constitute the public law of
the world, of which he is in some sort the interpreter and the
guardian.</p>

<p>Parallel with this development runs the second process making
for change: the increasing responsibility of diplomacy to public
opinion. To discuss all the momentous issues involved in this is
impossible; but the subject is too important to be altogether
passed over, since it is one of the main problems of modern
international intercourse, and concerns every one who by his vote
may influence the policy of the state to which he belongs. The
question, broadly speaking, is: how far has the public discussion
of international affairs affected the legitimate functions of
diplomacy for better or for worse? To the diplomatist of the
old school the answer seems clear. For him diplomacy was too
delicate and too personal an art to survive the glare and confusion
of publicity. Metternich, the last representative of the old <i>haute
diplomatie</i>, lived to moralize over the ruin caused by the first
manifestations of the &ldquo;new diplomacy,&rdquo; the outcome of the rise
of the power of public opinion. He had early, from his own point
of view, unfavourably contrasted the &ldquo;limited&rdquo; constitutional
monarchies of the west with the &ldquo;free&rdquo; autocracies of the east
of Europe, free because they were under no obligation to give a
public account of their actions. He himself was a master of the
old diplomatic art, of intrigue, of veiling his purpose under a cloud
of magniloquence, above all, of the art of personal fascination.
But public opinion was for him only a dangerous force to be kept
under control; and, even had he realized the necessity for appealing
to it, he had none of the qualities that would have made the
appeal successful. In direct antagonism to him was George
Canning, who may be called the great prototype of the  &ldquo;new
diplomacy,&rdquo; and to Metternich was a &ldquo;malevolent meteor hurled
by divine providence upon Europe.&rdquo; Canning saw clearly the
immense force that would be added to his diplomatic action if
he had behind him the force of public opinion. In answer to
Metternich&rsquo;s complaint of the tone of speeches in parliament and
of the popular support given in England to revolutionary movements,
he wrote, &ldquo;Our influence, if it is to be maintained abroad,
must be secure in its sources of strength at home: and the sources
of that strength are in the sympathy between the people and the
government; in the union of the public sentiment with the public
counsels; in the reciprocal confidence of the House of Commons
and the crown.&rdquo;<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>It would be a mistake to jump to the conclusion that Canning
was wholly right and Metternich wholly wrong. The conditions
of the Habsburg monarchy were not those of Great Britain,<a name="fa3d" id="fa3d" href="#ft3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
and even if it had been possible to speak of a public opinion in the
Austrian empire at all, it certainly possessed no such organ as
the British parliament. But the argument may be carried yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
further. In the abstract the success of the policy of a minister
in a democratic state must ultimately rest upon the support of
public opinion; yet the necessity for this support has in the
conduct of foreign affairs its peculiar dangers. In the difficult
game of diplomacy a certain reticence is always necessary. Secret
sources of information would be dried up were they to be lightly
revealed; a plain exposition of policy would often give an undue
advantage to the other party to a negotiation. Thus, even in
Great Britain, the diplomatic correspondence laid before parliament
is carefully edited, and all governments are jealous of
granting access to their modern archives. Yet a representative
assembly is apt to be resentful of such reservations. Its members
know little or nothing of the conditions under which foreign
affairs are conducted, and they are not unnaturally irritated
by explanations which seem to lack candour or completeness.
Canning himself had experience of this in the affair of the capture
of the Danish fleet at Copenhagen; and Castlereagh&rsquo;s diplomacy
was hampered by the bitter attacks of an opposition which
accused him, with little justice, of pursuing a policy which he
dared not reveal in its full scope to parliament. Moreover, the
appeal to public opinion may be used as a diplomatic weapon for
ends no less &ldquo;selfish&rdquo; than any aimed at by the old diplomacy.
Bismarck, whose statesmanship was at least as cynical as that of
Metternich, was a master of the art of taking the world into his
confidence&mdash;when it suited him to do so; and the &ldquo;reptile press,&rdquo;
hired to give a seemingly independent support to his policy,
was one of his most potent weapons. So far the only necessary
consequence of the growth of the power of public opinion on the
art of diplomacy has been to extend the sphere of its application;
it is but one more factor to be dealt with; and experience has
proved that it is subject to the wiles of a skilful diplomatist no
less than were the princes and statesmen with whom the old
diplomacy was solely concerned.</p>

<p>The third factor making for change&mdash;the revolution in the
means of communication which has brought all the world into
closer touch&mdash;remains to be discussed. It is obvious that before
the invention of the telegraph, the diplomatic agent was in a far
more responsible position than he is now, when he can, in most
cases, receive immediate instructions from his government on
difficult questions as they arise. When communication was still
slow there was often no time to await instructions, or the instructions
when they arrived were not seldom already out of date and
had to be set aside on the minister&rsquo;s own responsibility. It would,
however, be easy to exaggerate the importance of this change as
affecting the character and status of diplomatic agents. It is true
that the tendency has been for ministers of foreign affairs to hold
the threads of diplomacy in their own hands to a far greater
extent than was formerly the case; but they must still depend
for information and advice on the &ldquo;man on the spot,&rdquo; and the
success of their policy largely depends upon his qualities of
discretion and judgment. The growth of democracy, moreover,
has given to the ambassador a new and peculiar importance; for
he represents not only the sovereign to the sovereign, but the
nation to the nation; and, as a succession of notable American
ambassadors to Great Britain has proved, he may by his personal
qualities do a large amount to remove the prejudices and
ignorances which stand as a barrier between the nations. It
marks an immense advance in the comity of international
intercourse when the representatives of friendly powers are
no longer regarded as &ldquo;spies rather than ambassadors,&rdquo; to be
&ldquo;quickly heard and dismissed,&rdquo; as Philippe de Commines would
have them, but as agreeable guests to be parted from with regret.</p>

<p>As to the qualifications for an ambassador, it is clearly impossible
to lay down a general rule, for the same qualities are
obviously not required in Washington as in Vienna, nor in Paris
as in Pekin. Yet the effort to depict the ideal ambassador bulks
largely in the works of the earlier theorists, and the demands they
make are sufficiently alarming. Ottaviano Maggi, himself a
diplomatist of the brilliant age of the Renaissance, has left us in
his <i>De legato</i> (Hanoviae, 1596) his idea of what an ambassador
should be. He must not only be a good Christian but a learned
theologian; he must be a philosopher, well versed in Aristotle
and Plato, and able at a moment&rsquo;s notice to solve in correct
dialectical form the most abstruse problems; he must be well
read in the classics, and an expert in mathematics, architecture,
music, physics and civil and canon law. He must not only know
how to write and speak Latin with classical refinement, but he
must be a master of Greek, Spanish, French, German and Turkish.
He must have a sound knowledge of history, geography and the
science of war; but at the same time is not to neglect the poets,
and never to be without his Homer. Add to this that he must
be well born, rich and of a handsome presence, and we have
a portrait of a diplomatist whose original can hardly have
existed even in that age of brilliant versatility. The Dutchman
Frederikus de Marselaer, in his <span class="grk" title="kÃªrukeion">&#954;&#951;&#961;&#965;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span> <i>sive legationum
insigne</i> (Antwerp, 1618), is scarcely less exacting than the
Venetian. His ideal ambassador is a nobleman of fine presence
and in the prime of life, famous, rich, munificent, abstemious,
not violent, nor quarrelsome, nor morose, no flatterer, learned,
eloquent, witty without being talkative, a good linguist, widely
read, prudent and cautious, but brave and&mdash;as he adds somewhat
superfluously&mdash;many-sided.</p>

<p>With these theoretical perfections one or two instances of the
qualifications demanded by the exigencies of practical politics
may be cited by way of illuminating contrast. At the court of the
empress Elizabeth of Russia good looks were a surer means of
diplomatic success than all the talents and virtues, and the
princess of Zerbst (mother of the empress Catherine II.) wrote to
Frederick of Prussia advising him to replace his elderly ambassador
by a handsome young man with a good complexion;
and the essential qualification for an ambassador to Switzerland,
Germany, Poland, Denmark and Russia used to be that he should
be able to drink the native diplomatists, seasoned from babyhood
to strong liquors, under the table.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;In its widest sense the history of diplomacy is that of
the intercourse between nations, in so far as this has not been a
mere brute struggle for the mastery;<a name="fa4d" id="fa4d" href="#ft4d"><span class="sp">4</span></a> in a narrower sense, with
which the present article is alone concerned, it is that of the
methods and spirit of diplomatic intercourse and of the character
and status of diplomatic agents. Earlier writers on the office
and functions of ambassadors, such as Gentilis or Archbishop
Germonius, conscientiously trace their origin to God himself,
who created the angels to be his legates; and they fortify their
arguments by copious examples drawn from ancient history,
sacred and profane. But, whatever the influence upon it of
earlier practice, modern diplomacy really dates from the rise of
permanent missions, and the consequent development of the
diplomatic hierarchy as an international institution. Of this the
first beginnings are traceable to the 15th century and to Italy.
There had, of course, during the middle ages been embassies and
negotiations; but the embassies had been no more than temporary
missions directed to a particular end and conducted by
ecclesiastics or nobles of a dignity appropriate to each occasion;
there were neither permanent diplomatic agents nor a professional
diplomatic class. To the evolution of such a class the Italy of the
Renaissance, the nursing-ground of modern statecraft, gave the
first impetus. This was but natural; for Italy, with its numerous
independent states, between which there existed a lively intercourse
and a yet livelier rivalry, anticipated in miniature the
modern states&rsquo; system of Europe. In feudal Europe there had
been little room for diplomacy; but in northern and central Italy
feudalism had never taken root, and in the struggles of the
peninsula diplomacy had early played a part as great as, or greater
than, war. Where all were struggling for the mastery, the
existence of each depended upon alliances and counter-alliances,
of which the object was the maintenance of the balance of power.
In this school there was trained a notable succession of men of
affairs. Thus, in the 13th and 14th centuries Florence counted
among her envoys Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, and later on
could boast of agents such as Capponi, Vettori, Guicciardini and
Machiavelli. Papal Rome, too, as was to be expected, had
always been a fruitful nursing-mother of diplomatists; and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
authorities have traced the beginnings of modern diplomacy to a
conscious imitation of her legatine system.<a name="fa5d" id="fa5d" href="#ft5d"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<p>It is, however, in Venice, that the origins of modern diplomacy
are to be sought.<a name="fa6d" id="fa6d" href="#ft6d"><span class="sp">6</span></a> So early as the 13th century the republic, with
a view to safeguarding the public interests, began to lay down a
series of rules for the conduct of its ambassadors. Thus, in 1236,
envoys to the court of Rome are forbidden to procure a benefice
for anyone without leave of the doge and little council; in 1268
ambassadors are commanded to surrender on their return any
gifts they may have received, and by another decree they are
compelled to take an oath to conduct affairs to the honour and
advantage of the republic. About the same time it was decided
that diplomatic agents were to hand in, on their return, a written
account of their mission; in 1288 this was somewhat expanded by
a law decreeing that ambassadors were to deposit, within fifteen
days of their return, a written account of the replies made to them
during their mission, together with anything they might have seen
or heard to the honour or in the interests of the republic. These
provisions, which were several times renewed, notably in 1296,
1425 and 1533, are the origin of the famous reports of the
Venetian ambassadors to the senate, which are at once a monument
to the political genius of Venetian statesmen and a mine
of invaluable historical material.<a name="fa7d" id="fa7d" href="#ft7d"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>These are but a few examples of a long series of regulations,
many others also dating to the 13th century, by which the
Venetian government sought to systematize its diplomatic
service. That permanent diplomatic agencies were not established
by it earlier than was the case is probably due to the
distrust of its agents by which most of this legislation of the
republic is inspired. In the 13th century two or three months
was considered over-long a period for an ambassador to reside at
a foreign court; in the 15th century the period of residence was
extended to two years, and in the 16th century to three. This
latter rule continued till the end of the republic; the embassy
had become permanent, but the ambassador was changed every
three years.</p>

<p>The origin of the change from temporary to permanent missions
has been the subject of much debate and controversy. The theory
that it was due, in the first instance, to the evolution of the
Venetian consulates (<i>bajulats</i>) in the Levant into permanent
diplomatic posts, and that the idea was thence transferred to the
West, is disproved by the fact that Venice had established other
permanent embassies before the baylo (<i>q.v.</i>) at Constantinople was
transformed into a diplomatic agent of the first rank. Nor is
the first known instance of the appointment of a permanent
ambassador Venetian. The earliest record<a name="fa8d" id="fa8d" href="#ft8d"><span class="sp">8</span></a> is contained in the
announcement by Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan, in 1455, of his
intention to maintain a permanent embassy at Genoa<a name="fa9d" id="fa9d" href="#ft9d"><span class="sp">9</span></a>; and in
1460 the duke of Savoy sent Eusebio Margaria, archdeacon of
Vercelli, as his permanent representative to the Curia.<a name="fa10d" id="fa10d" href="#ft10d"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Though,
however, the early records of such appointments are rare, the
practice was probably common among the Italian states. Its
extension to countries outside Italy was a somewhat later development.
In 1494 Milan is already represented in France by a
permanent ambassador. In 1495 Zacharia Contarini, Venetian
ambassador to the emperor Maximilian, is described by Sanuto
(<i>Diarii</i>, i. 294) as <i>stato ambasciatore</i>; and from the time of
Charles V. onwards the succession of ambassadors of the republic
at the imperial court is fairly traceable. In 1496 &ldquo;as the way to
the British Isles is very long and very dangerous,&rdquo; two merchants
resident in London, Pietro Contarini and Luca Valaressa, were
appointed by the republic <i>subambasciatores</i>; and in June of the
same year Andrea Trevisano arrived in London as permanent
ambassador at the court of Henry VII.<a name="fa11d" id="fa11d" href="#ft11d"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Florence, too, from
1498 onwards, was represented at the courts of Charles V. and of
France by permanent ambassadors.</p>

<p>During the same period the practice had been growing up
among the other European powers. Spain led the way in 1487
by the appointment of Dr Roderigo Gondesalvi de Puebla as
ambassador in England. As he was still there in 1500, the
Spanish embassy in London may be regarded as the oldest still
surviving post of the new permanent diplomacy. Other states
followed suit, but only fitfully; it was not till late in the 16th
century that permanent embassies were regarded as the norm.
The precarious relations between the European powers during
the 16th century, indeed, naturally retarded the development of
the system. Thus it was not till after good relations had been
established with France by the treaty of London that, in 1519,
Sir Thomas Boleyn and Dr West were sent to Paris as resident
English ambassadors, and, after the renewed breach between the
two countries, no others were appointed till the reign of Elizabeth.
Nine years before, Sir Robert Wingfield, whose simplicity earned
him the nickname of &ldquo;Summer-shall-be-green,&rdquo; had been sent as
ambassador to the court of Charles V., where he remained from
1510 to 1517; and in 1520 the mutual appointment of resident
ambassadors was made a condition of the treaty between Henry
VIII. and Charles V. In 1517 Thomas Spinelly, who had for
some years represented England at the court of the Netherlands,
was appointed &ldquo;resident ambassador to the court of Spain,&rdquo;
where he remained till his death on the 22nd of August 1522.
These are the most important early instances of the new system.
Alone of the great powers, the emperor remained permanently
unrepresented at foreign courts. In theory this was the result
of his unique dignity, which made him superior to all other
potentates; actually it was because, as emperor, he could not
speak for the practically independent princes nominally his
vassals. It served all practical purposes if he were represented
abroad by his agents as king of Spain or archduke of Austria.</p>

<p>All the evidence now available goes to prove that the establishment
of permanent diplomatic agencies was not an unconscious
and accidental development of previous conditions, but deliberately
adopted as an obvious convenience. But, while all the
powers were agreed as to the convenience of maintaining such
agencies abroad, all were equally agreed in viewing the representatives
accredited to them by foreign states with extreme
suspicion. This attitude was abundantly justified by the
peculiar ethics of the new diplomacy. The old &ldquo;orators&rdquo; of the
Summer-shall-be-green type could not long hold their own
against the new men who had studied in the school of Italian
statecraft, for whom the end justified the means. Machiavelli
had gathered in <i>The Prince</i> and <i>The Discourses on Livy</i> the
principles which underlay the practice of his day in Italy;
Francis I., the first monarch to establish a completely organized
diplomatic machinery, did most to give these principles a
European extension. By the close of the 16th century diplomacy
had become frankly &ldquo;Machiavellian,&rdquo; and the ordinary rules of
morality were held not to apply to the intercourse between
nations. This was admitted in theory as well as in practice.
Germonius, after a vigorous denunciation of lying in general,
argues that it is permissible for the safety or convenience
(<i>commodo</i>) of princes, since <i>salus populi suprema lex</i>, and <i>quod
non permittit naturalis ratio, admittit civilis</i>; and he adduces
in support of this principle the answer given by Ulysses to
Neoptolemus, in the <i>Ajax</i> of Sophocles, and the examples of
Abraham, Jacob and David. Paschalius, while affirming that an
ambassador must study to speak the truth, adds that he is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>
such a &ldquo;rustic boor&rdquo; as to say that an &ldquo;official lie&rdquo; (<i>officiosum
mendacium</i>) is never to be employed, or to deny that an
ambassador should be, on occasion, <i>splendide mendax</i>.<a name="fa12d" id="fa12d" href="#ft12d"><span class="sp">12</span></a> The
situation is summed up in the famous definition of Sir Henry
Wotton, which, though excused by himself as a jest, was held to
be an indiscreet revelation of the truth: &ldquo;An ambassador is an
honest man sent to lie abroad for the good of his country.&rdquo;<a name="fa13d" id="fa13d" href="#ft13d"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
The most successful liar, in fact, was esteemed the most successful
diplomatist. &ldquo;A prime article of the catechism of ambassadors,&rdquo;
says Bayle in his <i>Dictionnaire critique</i> (1699), &ldquo;whatever their
religion, is to invent falsehoods and to go about making society
believe them.&rdquo; So universally was this principle adopted that,
in the end, no diplomatist even expected to be believed; and
the best way to deceive was&mdash;as Bismarck cynically avowed&mdash;to
tell the truth.</p>

<p>But, in addition to being a liar <i>ex officio</i>, the ambassador was
also &ldquo;an honourable spy.&rdquo; &ldquo;The principal functions of an
envoy,&rdquo; says Francois de CalliÃ¨res, himself an ex-ambassador of
Louis XIV., &ldquo;are two; the first is to look after the affairs of his
own prince; the second is to discover the affairs of the other.&rdquo;
A clever minister, he maintains, will know how to keep himself
informed of all that goes on in the mind of the sovereign, in the
councils of ministers or in the country; and for this end &ldquo;good
cheer and the warming effect of wine&rdquo; are excellent allies.<a name="fa14d" id="fa14d" href="#ft14d"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
This being so, it is hardly to be wondered at that foreign
ambassadors were commonly regarded as perhaps necessary, but
certainly very unwelcome, guests. The views of Philippe de
Commines have already been quoted above, and they were shared
by a long series of theoretical writers as well as by men of affairs.
Gentilis is all but alone in his protest against the view that all
ambassadors were <i>exploratores magis quam oratores</i>, and to be
treated as such. So early as 1481 the government of Venice had
decreed the penalty of banishment and a heavy fine for any one
who should talk of affairs of state with a foreign envoy, and
though the more civilized princes did not follow the example of
the sultan, who by way of precaution locked the ambassador of
Ferdinand II., Jerome Laski, into &ldquo;a dark and stinking place
without windows,&rdquo; they took the most minute precautions to
prevent the ambassadors of friendly powers from penetrating
into their secrets. Charles V. thought it safest to keep them as
far away as possible from his court. So did Francis I.; and, when
affairs were critical, he made his frequent changes of residence
and his hunting expeditions the excuse for escaping from
their presence. Henry VII. forbade his subjects to hold
any intercourse with them, and, later on, set spies upon them
and examined their correspondence&mdash;a practice by no means
confined to England. If the system of permanent embassies
survived, it is clear that this was mainly due to the belief of the
sovereigns that they gained more by maintaining &ldquo;honourable
spies&rdquo; at foreign courts than they lost by the presence of those
of foreign courts at their own. It was purely a question of the
balance of advantage. Neither among statesmen nor among
theorists was there any premonition of the great part to be
played by the permanent diplomatic body in the development
and maintenance of the concert of Europe. To Paschalius the
permanent embassies were &ldquo;a miserable outgrowth of a miserable
age.&rdquo;<a name="fa15d" id="fa15d" href="#ft15d"><span class="sp">15</span></a> Grotius himself condemned them as not only harmful,
but useless, the proof of the latter being that they were unknown
to antiquity.<a name="fa16d" id="fa16d" href="#ft16d"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p><i>Development of the Diplomatic Hierarchy.</i>&mdash;The history of
the diplomatic body<a name="fa17d" id="fa17d" href="#ft17d"><span class="sp">17</span></a> is, like that of other bodies, that of the
progressive differentiation of functions. The middle ages knew
no classification of diplomatic agents; the person sent on mission
is described indifferently as <i>legatus</i>, <i>orator</i>, <i>nuntius</i>, <i>ablegatus</i>,
<i>commissarius</i>, <i>procurator</i>, <i>mandatarius</i>, <i>agens</i> or <i>ambaxator</i>
(<i>ambassator,</i> &amp;c.). In Gundissalvus, <i>De legato</i> (1485), the oldest
printed work on the subject, the word <i>ambasiator</i>, first found in
a Venetian decree of 1268, is applied to any diplomat. Florence
was the first to make distinction; the <i>orator</i> was appointed by
the council of the republic; the <i>mandatorio</i>, with inferior powers,
by the Council of Ten. In 1500 Machiavelli, who held only the
latter rank, wrote from France urging the Signoria to send
<i>ambasiadori</i>. This was, however, rather a question of powers
than of dignity. But the causes which ultimately led to the
elaborate differentiation of diplomatic ranks were rather questions
of dignity than of functions.<a name="fa18d" id="fa18d" href="#ft18d"><span class="sp">18</span></a> The breakdown of feudalism,
with the consequent rise of a series of sovereign states or of states
claiming to be sovereign, of very various size and importance, led
to a certain confusion in the ceremonial relation between them,
which had been unknown to the comparatively clearly defined
system of the middle ages. The smaller states were eager to
assert the dignity of their actual or practical independence;
the greater powers were equally bent on &ldquo;keeping them in their
place.&rdquo; If the emperor, as has been stated above, was too
exalted to send ambassadors, certain of the lesser states were soon
esteemed too humble to be represented at the courts of the great
powers save by agents of an inferior rank. By the second half
of the 16th century, then, there are two classes of diplomatists,
ambassadors and residents or agents, the latter being accounted
ambassadors of the second class.<a name="fa19d" id="fa19d" href="#ft19d"><span class="sp">19</span></a> At first the difference of rank
was determined by the status of the sovereign by whom or to
whom the diplomatic agent was accredited; but early in the 16th
century it became fairly common for powers of the first rank to
send agents of the second class to represent them at courts of
an equal status. The reasons were various, and not unamusing.
First and foremost came the question of expense. The ambassador,
as representing the person of his sovereign, was bound
by the sentiment of the age to display an exaggerated magnificence.
His journeys were like royal progresses, his state entries
surrounded with every circumstance of pomp, and it was held to
be his duty to advertise the munificence of his prince by boundless
largesses. Had this munificence been as unlimited in fact as
in theory, all might have been well, but, in that age of vaulting
ambitions, depleted exchequers were the rule rather than the
exception in Europe; the records are full of pitiful appeals from
ambassadors for arrears of pay, and appointment to an embassy
often meant ruin, even to a man of substance. To give but one
example, Sir Richard Morison, Edward VI.&rsquo;s ambassador in
Germany, had to borrow money to pay his debts before he could
leave Augsburg (<i>Cal. State Pap. Edw. VI.</i>, No. 467), and later
on he writes from Hamburg (April 9, 1552) that he could buy
nothing, because everyone believed that he had packed up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>
readiness to flit secretly, for &ldquo;How must they buy things, where
men know their stuff is ready trussed up, and they fleeting every
day?&rdquo; (ib. No. 544). But the dignity of ambassador carried
another drawback besides expense; his function of &ldquo;honourable
spy&rdquo; was seriously hampered by the trammels of his position.
He was unable to move freely in society, but lived a ceremonial
existence in the midst of a crowd of retainers, through whom alone
it was proper for him to communicate with the world outside. It
followed that, though the office of ambassador was more dignified,
that of agent was more generally useful.</p>

<p>Yet a third cause, possibly the most immediately potent,
encouraged the growth of the lesser diplomatic ranks: the
question of precedence among powers theoretically equal.
Modern diplomacy has settled a difficulty which caused at one
time much heart-burning and even bloodshed by a simple appeal
to the alphabet. Great Britain feels no humiliation in signing
after France, if the reason be that her name begins with G; had
she not been Great, she would sign before. The vexed question of
the precedence of ambassadors, too, has been settled by the rule,
already referred to above, as to seniority of appointment. But
while the question remained unsettled it was obviously best to
evade it; and this was most easily done by sending an agent
of inferior rank to a court where the precedence claimed for an
ambassador would have been refused.</p>

<p>Thus set in motion, the process of differentiation continues
until the system is stereotyped in the 19th century. It is unnecessary
to trace this evolution here in any detail. It is mainly
a question of names, and diplomatic titles are no exception to the
general rule by which all titles tend to become cheapened and
therefore, from time to time, need to be reinforced by fresh verbal
devices. The method was the familiar one of applying terms
that had once implied a particular quality in a fashion that
implied actually nothing. The ambassador extraordinary had
originally been one sent on an extraordinary mission; for the
time and purpose of this mission his authority superseded that
of the resident ambassador. But by the middle of the 17th
century the custom had grown up of calling all ambassadors
&ldquo;extraordinary,&rdquo; in order to place them on an equality with the
others. The same process was extended to diplomatists of the
second rank; and envoys (<i>envoyÃ©</i> for <i>ablegatus</i>) were always
&ldquo;extraordinary,&rdquo; and as such claimed and received precedence
over mere &ldquo;residents,&rdquo; who in their day had asserted the same
claim against the agents&mdash;all three terms having at one time
been synonymous. Similarly a &ldquo;minister plenipotentiary&rdquo; had
originally meant an agent armed with full powers (<i>plein-pouvoir</i>);
but, by a like process, the combination came to mean as little as
&ldquo;envoy extraordinary&rdquo;&mdash;though a plenipotentiary <i>tout simple</i> is
still an agent, of no ceremonially defined dignity, despatched with
full powers to treat and conclude. Finally, the evolution of the
title of a diplomatist of the second rank is crowned by the high-sounding
combination, now almost exclusively used, of &ldquo;envoy
extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary.&rdquo; The ultimate fate
of the simple title &ldquo;resident&rdquo; was the same as that of &ldquo;agent.&rdquo;
Both had been freely sold by needy sovereigns to all and sundry
who were prepared to pay for what gave them a certain social
status. The &ldquo;agent&rdquo; fell thus into utter discredit, and those
&ldquo;residents&rdquo; who were still actual diplomatic agents became
&ldquo;ministers resident&rdquo; to distinguish them from the common herd.</p>

<p>The classification of diplomatic agents was for the first time
definitively included in the general body of international law by
the <i>RÃ¨glement</i> of the 19th of March 1815 at Vienna<a name="fa20d" id="fa20d" href="#ft20d"><span class="sp">20</span></a>; and the
whole question was finally settled at the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle
(November 21, 1818) when, the proposal to establish
precedence by the status of the accrediting powers having wisely
been rejected, diplomatic agents were divided into four classes:
(1) Ambassadors, legates, nuncios; (2) Envoys extraordinary
and ministers plenipotentiary, and other ministers accredited
direct to the sovereign; (3) Ministers resident; (4) ChargÃ©s
d&rsquo;affaires. With a few exceptions (<i>e.g.</i> Turkey), this settlement
was accepted by all states, including the United States of
America.</p>

<p><i>Rights and Privileges of Diplomatic Agents.</i>&mdash;These are partly
founded upon immemorial custom, partly the result of negotiations
embodied in international law. The most important, as it
is the most ancient, is the right of personal <i>inviolability</i> extended
to the diplomatic agent and the members of his suite. This
inviolability is maintained after a rupture between the two
governments concerned, and even after the outbreak of war.
The habit of the Ottoman government of imprisoning in the
Seven Towers the ambassador of a power with which it quarrelled
was but an exception which proved the rule. The second important
right is that of exterritoriality (<i>q.v.</i>), a convenient
fiction by which the house and equipages of the diplomatic agent
are regarded as the territory of the power by whom he is accredited.
This involves the further principle that the agent is in
no way subject to the receiving government. He is exempt from
taxation and from the payment at least of certain local rates. He
also enjoys immunity (1) from civil jurisdiction, <i>e.g.</i> he cannot be
sued, nor can his goods be seized, for debt; (2) from criminal
jurisdiction, <i>e.g.</i> he cannot be arrested and tried for a criminal
offence. For a crime of violence, however, or for plotting against
the state, he can be placed under the necessary restraint and
expelled the country.<a name="fa21d" id="fa21d" href="#ft21d"><span class="sp">21</span></a> These immunities extend to all the
members of an envoy&rsquo;s suite. The difficulties that might be
supposed to arise from such exemptions have not in practice been
found very serious; for though, in the case of crimes committed
by servants of agents of the first or second class the procedure is
not clearly defined, each case would easily be made the subject
of arrangement. In certain cases, <i>e.g.</i> embassies in Turkey, the
exterritoriality of ambassadors implies a fairly extensive criminal
jurisdiction; in other cases the dismissal of the servant would
deprive him of his diplomatic immunity and bring him under
the law of the land. The right of granting asylum claimed by
diplomatic agents in virtue of that of exterritoriality, at one time
much abused, is now strictly limited. A political or criminal
offender may seek asylum in a foreign embassy; but if, after a
request has been formally made for his surrender, the ambassador
refuses to deliver him up, the authorities may take the measures
necessary to effect his arrest, and even force an entrance into the
embassy for the purpose. The &ldquo;right of chapel&rdquo; (<i>droit de
chapelle</i>, or <i>droit de culte</i>), enjoyed by envoys in reference to their
exterritoriality, <i>i.e.</i> the right of free exercise of religious worship
within their house, formerly of great importance, has been
rendered superfluous by the spread of religious toleration. (See
L. Oppenheim, <i>Internat. Law</i> (London, 1905) ,i. p. 441, &amp;c.;
A.W. Haffter, <i>Das europÃ¤ische VÃ¶lkerrecht</i> (Berlin, 1888), p.
435, &amp;c.)</p>

<p><i>The Personnel of the &ldquo;Corps diplomatique.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;The establishment
of diplomacy as a regular branch of the civil service is of modern
growth, and even now by no means universal. From old time
states naturally chose as their agents those who would best
serve their interests in the matter in hand. In the middle ages
diplomacy was practically a monopoly of the clergy, who as a
class alone possessed the necessary qualifications: and in later
times, when learning had spread to the laity as well, there were
still potent reasons why the clergy should continue to be employed
as diplomatic agents. Of these reasons the most practical was
that of expense; for the wealth of the church formed an inexhaustible
reserve which was used without scruple for secular
purposes. Francis I. of France, who by the Concordat with Rome
had in his hands the patronage of all the sees and abbeys in
France, used this partly to reward his clerical ministers, partly as
a great secret service fund for bribing the ambassadors of other
powers, partly for the payment of those high-placed spies at
foreign courts maintained by the elaborately organized system
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
known as the <i>Secret du Roi</i>.<a name="fa22d" id="fa22d" href="#ft22d"><span class="sp">22</span></a> None the less, in the 16th century,
laymen as diplomats are already well in evidence. They are
usually lawyers, rarely soldiers, occasionally even simple
merchants. Not uncommonly they were foreigners, like the
Italian Thomas Spinelly mentioned above, drawn from that
cosmopolitan class of diplomats who were ready to serve any
master. Though nobles were often employed as ambassadors
by all the powers, Venice alone made nobility a condition of
diplomatic service. They were professional in the sense that, for
the most part, diplomacy was the main occupation of their lives;
there was, however, no graded diplomatic service in which, as at
present, it was possible to rise on a fixed system from the position
of simple <i>attachÃ©</i> to that of minister and ambassador. The
&ldquo;attachÃ© to the embassy&rdquo; existed<a name="fa23d" id="fa23d" href="#ft23d"><span class="sp">23</span></a>; but he was not, as is
now the case, a young diplomat learning his profession, but an
experienced man of affairs, often a foreigner employed by the
ambassador as adviser, secret service agent and general go-between,
and he was without diplomatic status.<a name="fa24d" id="fa24d" href="#ft24d"><span class="sp">24</span></a> The 18th
century saw the rise of the diplomatic service in the modern sense.
The elaboration of court ceremonial, for which Versailles had set
the fashion, made it desirable that diplomatic agents should
be courtiers, and young men of rank about the court began to be
attached to missions for the express purpose of teaching them the
art of diplomacy. Thus arose that aristocratic diplomatic class,
distinguished by the exquisite refinement of its manners, which
survived from the 18th century into the 19th. Modern democracy
has tended to break with this tradition, but it still widely prevails.
Even in Great Britain, where the rest of the public services have
been thrown open to all classes, a certain social position is still
demanded for candidates for the diplomatic service and the
foreign office, and in addition to passing a competitive examination,
they must be nominated by someone of recognized station
prepared to vouch for their social qualifications. In America,
where no regular diplomatic service exists, all diplomatic agents
are nominated by the president.</p>

<p>The existence of an official diplomatic service, however, by no
means excludes the appointment of outsiders to diplomatic posts.
It is, in fact, one of the main grievances of the regular diplomatic
body that the great rewards of their profession, the embassies,
are so often assigned to politicians or others who have not passed
through the drudgery of the service. But though this practice
has, doubtless, sometimes been abused, it is impossible to
criticize the wisdom of its occasional application.</p>

<p>A word may be added as to the part played by women in
diplomacy. So far as their unofficial influence upon it is concerned,
it would be impossible to exaggerate its importance; it
would suffice to mention three names taken at random from
the annals of the 19th century, Madame de StaÃ«l, Baroness
von KrÃ¼dener, and Princess Lieven. Gentz comments on the
&ldquo;feminine intrigues&rdquo; that darkened the counsels of the congresses
of Vienna and Aix-la-Chapelle, and from which the powers
so happily escaped in the bachelor seclusion of Troppau. Nor is
it to be supposed that statesmen will ever renounce a diplomatic
weapon so easy of disguise and so potent for use. A brilliant <i>salon</i>
presided over by a woman of charm may be a most valuable
centre of a political propaganda; and ladies are still widely
employed in the secret diplomacy of the powers. Their employment
as regularly accredited diplomatic agents, however, though
not unknown, has been extremely rare. An interesting instance
is the appointment of Catherine of Aragon, when princess of Wales,
as representative of her father, Ferdinand the Catholic, at the
court of Henry VII. (G. A. Bergenroth, <i>Calendar of State Papers
 ... England and Spain&mdash;in the Archives at Simancas, &amp;c.</i>, i. pp.
xxxiii, cxix).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature.</span>&mdash;Besides general works on international law (<i>q.v.</i>)
which necessarily deal with the subject of diplomacy, a vast mass
of treatises on diplomatic agents exists. The earliest printed work
is the <i>Tractatus de legato</i> (Rome, 1485) of Gundissalvus (Gonsalvo de
Villadiego), professor of law at Salamanca, auditor for Spain at the
Roman court of the Rota, and bishop of Oviedo; but the first really
systematic writer on the subject was Albericus Gentilis, <i>De legationibus
libri iii</i>. (London, 1583, 1585, Hanover, 1596, 1607, 1612). For a full
bibliography of works on ambassadors see Baron Diedrich H. L. von
Ompteda, <i>Litteratur des gesammten sowohl natÃ¼rlichen als positiven
VÃ¶lkerrechts</i> (Regensburg, 1785), p. 534, &amp;c., which was completed and
continued by the Prussian minister Karl Albert von Kamptz, in
<i>Neue Literatur des VÃ¶lkerrechts seit dem Jahre 1784</i> (Berlin, 1817),
p. 231. A list of writers, with critical and biographical remarks, is
also given in Ernest Nys&rsquo;s &ldquo;Les Commencements de la diplomatie et
le droit d&rsquo;ambassade jusqu&rsquo;Ã  Grotius,&rdquo; in the <i>Revue de droit international</i>,
vol. xvi. p. 167. Other useful modern works on the history
of diplomacy are: E. C. Grenville-Murray, <i>Embassies and Foreign
Courts, a History of Diplomacy</i> (2nd ed., 1856); J. Zeller, <i>La Diplomatie
franÃ§aise vers le milieu du XVI^e siÃ¨cle</i> (Paris, 1881); A. O.
Meyer, <i>Die englische Diplomatie in Deutschland zur Zeit Eduards VI.
und Mariens</i> (Breslau, 1900); and, above all, Otto Krauske, <i>Die
Entwickelung der stÃ¤ndgien Diplomatie vom fÃ¼nfzehnten Jahrhundert
bis zu den BeschlÃ¼ssen von 1815 und 1818</i>, in Gustav Schmoller&rsquo;s
<i>Staats- und socialwissenschaftliche Forschungen</i>, vol. v. (Leipzig, 1885).
To these may be added, as admirably illustrating in detail the early
developments of modern diplomacy, Logan Pearsall Smith&rsquo;s <i>Life and
Letters of Sir Henry Wotton</i> (Oxford, 1907). Of works on modern
diplomacy the most important are the <i>Guide diplomatique</i> of Baron
Charles de Martens, new edition revised by F. H. Geffcken, 2 vols.
(Leipzig, 1866), and P. Pradier-FodÃ©rÃ©, <i>Cours de droit diplomatique</i>,
2 vols. (Paris, 1881).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIPLOMATIC,<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> the science of diplomas, founded on the critical
study of the &ldquo;diplomatic&rdquo; sources of history: diplomas,
charters, acts, treaties, contracts, judicial records, rolls, chartularies,
registers, &amp;c. The employment of the word &ldquo;diploma,&rdquo;
as a general term to designate an historical document, is of comparatively
recent date. The Roman diploma, so called because
it was formed of two sheets of metal which were shut together
(Gr. <span class="grk" title="diploun">&#948;&#953;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span>, to double) like the leaves of a book, was the passport
or licence to travel by the public post; also, the certificate
of discharge, conferring privileges of citizenship and marriage
on soldiers who had served their time; and, later, any imperial
grant of privileges. The word was adopted, rather pedantically,
by the humanists of the Renaissance and applied by them to
important deeds and to acts of sovereign authority, to privileges
granted by kings and by great personages; and by degrees the
term became extended and embraced generally the documents of
the middle ages.</p>

<p><i>History of the Study.</i>&mdash;The term &ldquo;diplomatic,&rdquo; the French
<i>diplomatique</i>, is a modern adaptation of the Latin phrase <i>res
diplomatica</i> employed in early works upon the subject, and more
especially in the first great text-book, the <i>De re diplomatica</i>,
issued in 1681 by the learned Benedictine, Dom Jean Mabillon,
of the abbey of St Germain-des-PrÃ©s. Mabillon&rsquo;s treatise was
called forth by an earlier work of Daniel van Papenbroeck, the
editor of the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> of the Bollandists, who, with no
great knowledge or experience of archives, undertook to criticize
the historical value of ancient records and monastic documents,
and raised wholesale suspicions as to their authenticity in his
<i>Propylaeum antiquarium circa veri ac falsi discrimen in vetustis
membranis</i>, which he printed in 1675. This was a rash challenge
to the Benedictines, and especially to the congregation of St Maur,
or confraternity of the Benedictine abbeys of France, whose
combined efforts produced great literary works which still remain
as monuments of profound learning. Mabillon was at that time
engaged in collecting material for a great history of his order. He
worked silently for six years before producing the work above
referred to. His refutation of Papenbroeck&rsquo;s criticisms was
complete, and his rival himself accepted Mabillon&rsquo;s system of
the study of diplomatic as the true one. The <i>De re diplomatica</i>
established the science on a secure basis; and it has been the
foundation of all subsequent works on the subject, although the
immediate result of its publication was a flood of controversial
writings between the Jesuits and the Benedictines, which, however,
did not affect its stability.</p>

<p>In Spain, the Benedictine Perez published, in 1688, a series
of dissertations following the line of Mabillon&rsquo;s work. In England,
Madox&rsquo;s <i>Formulare Anglicanum</i>, with a dissertation concerning
ancient charters and instruments, appeared in 1702, and
in 1705 Hickes followed with his <i>Linguarum septentrionalium
thesaurus</i>, both accepting the principles laid down by the learned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span>
Benedictine. In Italy, Maffei appeared with his <i>Istoria diplomatica</i>
in 1727, and Muratori, in 1740, introduced dissertations
on diplomatic into his great work, the <i>Antiquitates Italicae</i>. In
Germany, the first diplomatic work of importance was that by
Bessel, entitled <i>Chronicon Gotwicense</i> and issued in 1732; and
this was followed closely by similar works of Baring, Eckhard
and Heumann.</p>

<p>France, however, had been the cradle of the science, and that
country continued to be the home of its development. Mabillon
had not taken cognizance of documents later than the 13th
century. Arising out of a discussion relative to the origin of the
abbey of St Victor en Caux and the authenticity of its archives,
a more comprehensive work than Mabillon&rsquo;s was compiled by
the two Benedictines, Dom Toustain and Dom Tassin, viz. the
<i>Nouveau TraitÃ© de diplomatique</i>, in six volumes, 1750-1765,
which embraced more than diplomatic proper and extended to
all branches of Latin palaeography. With great industry the
compilers gathered together a mass of details; but their arrangement
is faulty, and the text is broken up into such a multitude of
divisions and subdivisions that it is tediously minute. However,
its more extended scope has given the <i>Nouveau TraitÃ©</i> an advantage
over Mabillon&rsquo;s work, and modern compilations have
drawn largely upon it.</p>

<p>As a result of the Revolution, the archives of the middle ages
lost in France their juridical and legal value; but this rather
tended to enhance their historical importance. The taste for
historical literature revived. The AcadÃ©mie des Inscriptions
fostered it. In 1821 the Ã‰cole des Chartes was founded; and,
after a few years of incipient inactivity, it received a further
impetus, in 1829, by the issue of a royal ordinance re-establishing
it. Thenceforth it has been an active centre for the teaching
and for the encouragement of the study of diplomatic throughout
the country, and has produced results which other nations may
envy. Next to France, Germany and Austria are distinguished
as countries where activity has been displayed in the systematic
study of diplomatic archives, more or less with the support of the
state. In Italy, too, diplomatic science has not been neglected.
In England, after a long period of regrettable indifference to the
study of the national and municipal archives of the country, some
effort has been made in recent years to remove the reproach. The
publications of the Public Record Office and of the department of
MSS. in the British Museum are more numerous and are issued
more regularly than in former times; and an awakened interest
is manifested by the foundation in the universities of a few
lectureships in diplomatic and palaeography, and by the attention
which those subjects receive in such an institution as the London
School of Economics, and in the publications of private literary
societies. But such efforts can never show the systematic results
which are to be attained by a special institution of the character
of the French Ã‰cole des Chartes.</p>

<p><i>Extent of the Science.</i>&mdash;The field covered by the study of
diplomatic is so extensive and the different kinds of documents
which it takes into its purview are so numerous and various, that
it is impossible to do more than give a few general indications
of their nature. No nation can have advanced far on the path
of civilization before discovering the necessity for documentary
evidence both in public and in private life. The laws, the
constitutions, the decrees of government, on the one hand, and
private contracts between man and man, on the other, must be
embodied in formal documents, in order to ensure permanent
record. In the case of a nation advancing independently from a
primitive to a later stage of civilization we should have to trace
the origin of its documentary records and examine their development
from a rudimentary condition. But in an inquiry into the
history of the documents of the middle ages in Europe we do
not begin with primitive forms. Those ages inherited the documentary
system which had been created and developed by the
Romans; and, imperfect and limited in number as are the
earliest surviving charters and diplomas of European medieval
history, they present themselves to us fully developed and cast in
the mould and employing the methods and formulae of the earlier
tradition. Based on this foundation the chanceries of the several
countries of Europe, as they came into existence and were
organized, reduced to method and rule on one general system the
various documents which the exigencies of public and of private
life from time to time called into existence, each individual
chancery at the same time following its own line of practice in
detail, and evolving and confirming particular formulas which
have become characteristic of it.</p>

<p><i>Classification of Documents.</i>&mdash;If we classify these documents
under the two main heads of public and private deeds, we shall
have to place in the former category the legislative, administrative,
judicial, diplomatic documents emanating from public
authority in public form: laws, constitutions, ordinances,
privileges, grants and concessions, proclamations, decrees,
judicial records, pleas, treaties; in a word, every kind of deed
necessary for the orderly government of a civilized state. In
early times many of these were comprised under the general
term of &ldquo;letters,&rdquo; <i>litterae</i>, and to the large number of them
which were issued in open form and addressed to the community
the specific title of &ldquo;letters patent,&rdquo; <i>litterae patentes</i>, was given.
In contradistinction those public documents which were issued
in closed form under seal were known as &ldquo;close letters,&rdquo; <i>litterae
clausae</i>.</p>

<p>Such public documents belong to the state archives of their
several countries, and are the monuments of administrative and
political and domestic history of a nation from one generation to
another. In no country has so perfect a series been preserved as
in our own. Into the Public Record Office in London have been
brought together all the collections of state archives which were
formerly stored in different official repositories of the kingdom.
Beginning with the great survey of Domesday, long series of
enrolments of state documents, in many instances extending
from the times of the Angevin kings to our own day in almost
unbroken sequence, besides thousands of separate deeds of all
descriptions, are therein preserved (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Record</a></span>).</p>

<p>Under the category of private documents must be included, not
only the deeds of individuals, but also those of corporate bodies
representing private interests and standing in the position of
individual units in relation to the state, such as municipal bodies
and monastic foundations. The largest class of documents of
this character is composed of those numerous conveyances of real
property and other title deeds of many descriptions and dating
from early periods which are commonly described by the generic
name of &ldquo;charters,&rdquo; and which are to be found in thousands, not
only in such public repositories as the Public Record Office and
the British Museum, but also in the archives of municipal and
other corporate bodies throughout the country and in the
muniment-rooms of old families. There are also the records
of the manorial courts preserved in countless court-rolls and
registers; also the scattered muniments of the dissolved
monasteries represented by the many collections of charters
and the valuable chartularies, or registers of charters, which
have fortunately survived and exist both in public and in
private keeping.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in this enumeration of public and private
documents in England reference is made to rolls. The practice of
entering records on rolls has been in favour in England from a very
early date subsequent to the Norman Conquest; and while in
other countries the comprehensive term of &ldquo;charters&rdquo; (literally
&ldquo;papers&rdquo;: Gr. <span class="grk" title="chartÃªs">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>) is employed as a general description of
documents of the middle ages, in England the fuller phrase
&ldquo;charters and rolls&rdquo; is required. The master of the rolls,
the <i>Magister Rotulorum</i>, is the official keeper of the public
records.</p>

<p>From the great body of records, both public and private, many
fall easily and naturally into the class in which the text takes
a simpler narrative form; such as judicial records, laws, decrees,
proclamations, registers, &amp;c., which tell their own story in
formulae and phraseology early developed and requiring little
change. These we may leave on one side. For fuller description
we select those deeds which, conferring grants and favours and
privileges, conform more nearly to the idea of the Roman diploma
and have received the special attention of the chanceries in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
development and arrangement of their formulae and in their
methods of execution.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p>All such medieval deeds are composed of certain recognized
members or sections, some essential, others special and peculiar to
the most elaborate and solemn documents. A deed of
the more elaborate character is made up of two principal
<span class="sidenote">Structure of medieval diplomas.</span>
divisions: 1. the <span class="sc">Text</span>, in which is set out the object of
the deed, the statement of the considerations and circumstances
which have led to it, and the declaration of the will
and intention of the person executing the deed, together with such
protecting clauses as the particular circumstances of the case may
require; 2. the <span class="sc">Protocol</span> (originally, the first sheet of a papyrus
roll; Gr. <span class="grk" title="prÃ´tos">&#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, first, and <span class="grk" title="kollan">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8118;&#957;</span>, to glue), consisting of the
introductory and of the concluding formulae: superscription,
address, salutation, &amp;c., at the beginning, and date, formulae of
execution, &amp;c., at the end, of the deed. The latter portion of the
protocol is sometimes styled the eschatocol (Gr. <span class="grk" title="eschatos">&#7956;&#963;&#967;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, last,
and <span class="grk" title="kollan">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8118;&#957;</span>, to glue). While the text followed certain formulae which
had become fixed by common usage, the protocol was always special
and varied with the practices of the several chanceries, changing in
a sovereign chancery with each successive reign.</p>

<p>The different sections of a full deed, taking them in order under
the heads of Initial Protocol, Text and Final Protocol or Eschatocol,
are as follows:&mdash;The initial protocol consists of the Invocation, the
Superscription, the Address and the Salutation. 1. The
<span class="sidenote">The Invocation.</span>
<span class="sc">Invocation</span>, lending a character of sanctity to the proceedings,
might be either verbal or symbolic. The verbal
invocation consisted usually of some pious ejaculation, such as <i>In
nomine Dei, In nomine domini nostri Jesu Christi</i>; from the 8th century,
<i>In nomine Sanctae et individuae Trinitatis</i>; and later, <i>In nomine
Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti</i>. The symbolic form was usually
the <i>chrismon</i>, or monogram composed of the Greek initials &Chi;&Rho; of the
name of Christ. In the course of the 10th and 11th centuries this
symbol came to be so scrawled that it had probably lost all meaning
with the scribes. From the 9th century the letter C (initial of
<i>Christus</i>) came gradually into use, and in German imperial diplomas
it superseded the <i>chrismon</i>. Stenographic signs of the system known
as Tironian notes were also sometimes added to this symbol down
to the end of the 10th century, expressing such a phrase as <i>Ante
omnia Christus</i>, or <i>Christus</i>, or <i>Amen</i>. From the Merovingian period,
too, a cross was often used. The symbol gradually died out after the
12th century for general use, surviving only in notarial instruments
<span class="sidenote">The Superscription.</span>
and wills. 2. The <span class="sc">Superscription</span> (<i>superscriptio, intitulatio</i>)
expressed the name and titles of the grantor or person
issuing the deed. 3. The <span class="sc">Address</span>. As diplomas were
originally in epistolary form the address was then a
necessity. While in Merovingian deeds the old pattern was adhered
<span class="sidenote">The Address.</span>
to, in the Carolingian period the address was sometimes
omitted. From the 8th century it was not considered necessary,
and a distinction arose in the case of royal acts, those
having the address being styled letters, and those omitting it,
charters. The general form of address ran in phrase as <i>Omnibus</i>
<span class="sidenote">The Salutation.</span>
(or <i>Universis</i>) <i>Christi fidelibus presentes litteras inspecturis</i>.
4. The <span class="sc">Salutation</span> was expressed in such words as
<i>Salutem</i>; <i>Salutem et dilectionem</i>; <i>Salutem et apostolicam
benedictionem</i>, but it was not essential.</p>






<p>Then follows the text in five sections: the Preamble, the Notification,
the Exposition, the Disposition and the Final Clauses. 5. The
<span class="sidenote">The Preamble.</span>
<span class="sc">Preamble</span> (<i>prologus</i>, <i>arenga</i>): an ornamental introduction
generally composed of pious or moral sentiments, a
<i>prefatio ad captandam benevolentiam</i> which <i>facit ad
ornamentum</i>, degenerating into tiresome platitudes. It became
stereotyped at an early age: in the 10th and 11th
<span class="sidenote">The Notification.</span>
centuries it was a most ornate performance; in the
12th century it was cut short; in the 13th century it
died out. 6. The <span class="sc">Notification</span> (<i>notificatio</i>, <i>promulgatio</i>)
was the publication of the purport of the deed introduced by
<span class="sidenote">The Exposition.<br />The Disposition.<br />The Final Clauses.</span>
such a phrase as <i>notum sit</i>, &amp;c. 7. The <span class="sc">Exposition</span>
set out the motives influencing the issue of the deed. 8. The
<span class="sc">Disposition</span> described the object of the deed and the will
and intention of the grantor. 9. The <span class="sc">Final Clauses</span> ensured
the fulfilment of the terms of the deed; guarded
against infringement, by comminatory anathemas and imprecations,
not infrequently of a vehement description, or
by penalties; guaranteed the validity of the deed; enumerated the
formalities of subscription and execution; reserved rights, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Next comes the final protocol or eschatocol comprising: the Date,
the Appreciation, the Authentication. It was particularly in this
portion of the deed that the varying practices of the several
chanceries led to minute and intricate distinctions at
<span class="sidenote">The Date.</span>
different periods. 10. The <span class="sc">Date</span>. By the Roman law
every act must be dated by the day and the year of execution.
Yet in the middle ages, from the 9th to the 12th century,
a large proportion of deeds bears no date. In the most
ancient charters the date clause was frequently separated from
the body of the deed and placed in an isolated position
at the foot of the sheet. From the 12th century it commonly
followed the text immediately. Certain classes of documents,
such as decrees of councils, notarial deeds, &amp;c., began with
the date. The usual formula was <i>data, datum, actum, factum, scriptum</i>.
In the Carolingian period a distinction grew up between
<i>datum</i> and <i>actum</i>, the former applying to the time, the latter
to the place, of date. In the papal chancery from an early period
down to the 12th century the use of a double date prevailed, the first
following the text and being inserted by the scribe when the deed
was written (<i>scriptum</i>), the second being added at the foot of the
deed on its execution (<i>actum</i>), by the chancellor or other high
functionary. From the Roman custom of dating by the consular
year arose the medieval practice of dating by the regnal year of
emperor, king or pope. Special dates were sometimes employed,
such as the year of some great historical event, battle, siege, pestilence,
&amp;c.  11. The <span class="sc">Appreciation</span>. The <i>feliciter</i> of the
<span class="sidenote">The Appreciation.</span>
Romans became the medieval <i>feliciter in Domino</i>, or
<i>In Dei nomine feliciter</i>, or the more simple <i>Deo gratias</i>
or the still more simple <i>Amen</i>, for the auspicious closing of a deed.
In Merovingian and Carolingian diplomas it follows the date; in
other cases it closes the text. In the greater papal bulls it appears
in the form of a triple <i>Amen</i>. <i>Benevalete</i> was also employed as the
appreciation in early deeds; but in Merovingian diplomas and in
papal bulls this valedictory salutation becomes a mark of authentication,
as will be noticed below.  12. The <span class="sc">Authentication</span> was a
<span class="sidenote">The Authentication.</span>
solemn proceeding which was discharged by more than
one act. The most important was the subscription or
subscriptions of the person or persons from whom the deed
emanated. The laws of the late Roman empire required the
subscriptions and the impressions of the signet seals of the parties
and of the witnesses to the deed. The subscription (<i>subscriptio</i>) comprised
the name, signature and description of the person signing.
The impression of the signet (not the signature) was the <i>signum</i>,
sometimes <i>signaculum</i>, rarely <i>sigillum</i>. The practice of subscribing
with the autograph signature obtained in the early middle ages, as
appears from early documents such as those of Ravenna. But from
the 7th century it began to decline, and by the 12th century it had
practically ceased. In Roman deeds an illiterate person affixed his
mark, or <i>signum manuale</i>, which was attested. The cross being an
easy form for a mark, it was very commonly used and naturally
became connected with the Christian symbol. Hence, in course of
time, it came to be attached very generally to subscriptions, autograph
or otherwise. Great personages who were illiterate required
something more elaborate than a common mark. Hence arose the
use of the monogram, the <i>caracter nominis</i>, composed of the letters of
the name. The emperor Justin, who could not write, made use of
a monogram, as did also Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths. Those
Merovingian kings, likewise, who were illiterate, had their individual
monograms; and at length Charlemagne adopted the monogram as
his regular form of signature. From his reign down to that of Philip
the Fair the monogram was the recognized sign manual of the
sovereigns of France (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Autographs</a></span>). It was employed by the
German emperors down to the reign of Maximilian I. The royal use
of the monogram was naturally imitated by great officers and
ecclesiastics. But another form of sign manual also arose out of
the subscription. The closing word (usually <i>subscripsi</i>), written or
abbreviated as <i>sub.</i>, or <i>ss.</i> or <i>s.</i>, was often finished off with flourishes
and interlacings, sometimes accompanied with Tironian notes, the
whole taking the shape of a domed structure to which the French
have given the name of <i>ruche</i> or bee-hive. Thus in the early middle
ages we have deeds authenticated by the subscription, usually
autograph, giving the name and titles of the person executing, and
stating the part taken by him in the deed, and closing with the
<i>subscripsi</i>, often in shape of the ruche and constituting the <i>signum
manuale</i>. If not autograph, the subscription might be impersonal
in such form as <i>signum</i> (or <i>signum manus</i>) + N. In the Carolingian
period, while phrases were constantly used in the body of the deed
implying that it was executed by autograph subscription, it did
not necessarily follow that such subscription was actually written in
person. The ruche was also adopted by chancellors, notaries and
scribes as their official mark. While autograph subscriptions
continued to be employed, chiefly by ecclesiastics, down to the beginning
of the 12th century, the monogram was perpetuated from the
10th century by the notaries. Their marks, simple at first, became
so elaborate from the end of the 13th century that they found it
necessary to add their names in ordinary writing, or also to employ
a less complicated design. This was the commencement of the
modern practice of writing the signature which first came into vogue
in the 14th century.</p>

<p>To lend further weight and authority to the subscription, certain
symbols and forms were added at different periods. Imitating,
the corroborative <i>Legi</i> of the Byzantine quaestor and the <i>Legimus</i>
of the Eastern emperors, the Frankish chancery in the West made use
of the same form, notably in the reign of Charles the Bald, in some of
whose diplomas the <i>Legimus</i> appears written in larger letters in red.
The valedictory <i>Benevalete</i>, employed in early deeds as a form of
<span class="sidenote">The Benevalete.</span>
appreciation (see above), appears in Merovingian and in
early Carolingian royal diplomas, and also in papal bulls,
as an authenticating addition to the subscription. In the
diplomas it was written in cursive letters in two lines, <i>Bene valete</i>,
just to the right of the incision cut in the sheet to hold fast the seal,
which sometimes even covered part of the word. In the most ancient
papal bulls it was written by the pope himself at the foot of the deed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
in two lines, generally in larger capital or uncial characters, placed
between two crosses. From the beginning of the 11th century it
became the fashion to link the letters; and, dating from the time of
Leo IX., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1048-1054, the <i>Benevalete</i> was inscribed in form of a
monogram. During Leo&rsquo;s pontificate it was also accompanied with
a flourish called the <i>Komma</i>, which was only an exaggeration of the
mark of punctuation (<i>periodus</i>) which from the 9th to the 11th
century closed the subscription and generally resembled the modern
semicolon. Leo&rsquo;s successors abandoned the <i>Komma</i>, but the monogrammatic
<i>Benevalete</i> continued, invariable in form, but from time
to time varying in size.  In Leo IX.&rsquo;s pontificate also was introduced
the <i>Rota</i>. This sign, when it had received its final shape in the
<span class="sidenote">The Rota.</span>
11th century, was in form of a wheel, composed of two
concentric circles, in the space between which was written
the motto or device of the pope (<i>signum papae</i>), usually a
short sentence from one of the Psalms or some other portion of
Scripture; preceded by a small cross, which the pontiff himself
sometimes inscribed. The central space within the wheel was
divided (by cross lines) into four quarters, the two upper ones being
occupied by the names of the apostles St Peter and St Paul, and the
two lower ones by the name of the pope. The <i>Rota</i> was placed on the
left of the subscription, the monogrammatic <i>Benevalete</i> on the right.
The two signs were likewise adopted by certain ecclesiastical
chanceries and by feudal lords, particularly in the 12th century.
From the same period also the Spanish and Portuguese monarchs
adopted the <i>Rota</i>, the <i>signo rodado</i>, which is so conspicuous in the
royal charters of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Besides the subscription, an early auxiliary method of authentication
was by the impression of the seal which, as noticed above, was
required by the Roman law. But the general use of
the signet gradually failed, and by the 7th century it
<span class="sidenote">Sealing.</span>
had ceased. Still it survived in the royal chanceries, and the
sovereigns both of the Merovingian and of the Carolingian lines had
their seals; and, in the 8th century, the mayors of the palace likewise.
It is interesting to find instances of the use of antique intaglios
for the purpose by some of them. In England too there is proof that
the Mercian kings Offa and Coenwulf used seals, in imitation of the
Frankish monarchs. In the 7th century, and still more so in the
8th and 9th centuries, the royal seals were of exaggerated size: the
precursors of the great seals of the later sovereigns of western Europe.
The waxen seals of the early diplomas were in all cases <i>en placard</i>:
that is, they were attached to the face of the document and not suspended
from it, being held in position by a cross-cut incision in the
material, through which the wax was pressed and then flattened at
the back. On the cessation of autograph signatures in subscriptions,
the general use of seals revived, beginning in the 10th century and
becoming the ordinary method of authentication from the 12th to
the 15th century inclusive. Even when signatures had once again
become universal, the seal continued to hold its place; and thus
sealing is, to the present day, required for the legal execution of a
deed. The attachment <i>en placard</i> was discontinued, as a general
practice, in the middle of the 11th century; and seals thenceforward
were, for the most part, suspended, leathern thongs being used at
first, and afterwards silken and hempen cords or parchment labels.
In documents of minor importance it was sometimes the custom to
impress the seal or seals on one or more strips of the parchment of the
deed itself, cut, but not entirely detached, from the lower margin,
and left to hang loose. Besides waxen impressions of seals, impressions
in metal, bearing a device on both faces, after the fashion
of a coin, and suspended, were employed from an early period. The
most widely known instances are the <i>bullae</i> attached to papal documents,
generally of lead. The earliest surviving papal <i>bulla</i> is one
of Pope Zacharias, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 746, but earlier examples are known from
drawings. The papal <i>bulla</i> was a disk of metal stamped on both sides.
From the time of Boniface V. to Leo IV., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 617-855, the name of
the pontiff, in the genitive case, was impressed on the obverse, and
his title as pope on the reverse, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Bonifati/ papae</i>. After that
period, for some time, the name was inscribed in a circle round a
central ornament. Other variations followed; but at length in the
pontificate of Paschal II., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1099, the <i>bulla</i> took the form which it
afterwards retained: on the obverse, the heads of the apostles
St Peter and St Paul; on the reverse, the pope&rsquo;s name, title and
number in succession. In the period of time between his election
and consecration, the pope made use of the half-bull, that is, the
obverse only was impressed. It should be mentioned that, in order
to conform to modern conditions and for convenience of despatch
through the post, Leo XII., in 1878, substituted for the leaden <i>bulla</i>
a red ink stamp bearing the heads of the two apostles with the
name of the pope inscribed as a legend.</p>

<p>The Carolingian monarchs also used metal <i>bullae</i>. None of
Charlemagne&rsquo;s have survived, but there are still extant leaden examples
of Charles the Bald. The use of lead was not persisted in
either in the chancery of France or in that of Germany. Golden
<i>bullae</i> were employed on special occasions by both popes and temporal
monarchs; for example, they were attached to the confirmations of
the elections of the emperors in the 12th and 13th centuries; the
bull of Leo X. conferring the title of Defender of the Faith on
Henry VIII. in 1524, and the deed of alliance between Henry and
Francis I. in 1527, had golden <i>bullae</i>; and other examples could be
cited. But lead has always been the common metal to be thus
employed. In the southern countries of Europe, where the warmth
of the climate renders wax an undesirable material, leaden <i>bullae</i>
have been in ordinary use, not only in Italy but also in the Peninsula,
in southern France, and in the Latin East (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seals</a></span>).</p>

<p>The necessity of conforming to exact phraseology in diplomas and
of observing regularity in expressing formulas naturally led to the
compilation of formularies. From the early middle ages
the art of composition, not only of charters but also of
<span class="sidenote">Formularies.</span>
general correspondence, was commonly taught in the
monasteries. The teacher was the <i>dictator</i>, his method of teaching
was described by the verb <i>dictare</i>, and his teaching was <i>dictamen</i> or
the <i>ars dictaminis</i>. For the use of these monastic schools, formularies
and manuals comprising formulas and models for the composition
of the various acts and documents soon became indispensable. At
a later stage such formularies developed into the models and treatises
for epistolary style which have had their imitations even in modern
times. The widespread use of the formularies had the advantage of
imposing a certain degree of uniformity on the phrasing of documents
of the western nations of Europe. Those compilations which are
of an earlier period than the 11th century have been systematically
examined and are published; those of more recent date still remain
to be thoroughly edited. The early formularies are of the simpler
kind, being collections of formulas without dissertation. The
<i>Formulae Marculfi</i>, compiled by the monk Marculf about the year
650, was the most important work of this nature of the Merovingian
period and became the official formulary of the time; and it continued
in use in a revised edition in the early Carolingian chancery.
Of the same period there are extant formularies compiled at various
centres, such as Angers, Tours, Bourges, Sens, Reichenau, St Gall,
Salzburg, Passau, Regensburg, Cordova, &amp;c. (see Giry, <i>Manuel
de diplomatique</i>, pp. 482-488). The <i>Liber diurnus Romanorum
Pontificum</i> was compiled in the 7th and 8th centuries, and was employed
in the papal chancery to the end of the 11th century. Of the
more developed treatises and manuals of epistolary rhetoric which
succeeded, and which originated in Italy, the earliest example was
the <i>Breviarium de dictamine</i> of the monk Alberic of Monte Cassino,
compiled about the year 1075. Another well-known work, the
<i>Rationes dictandi</i>, is also attributed to the same author. Of later date
was the <i>Ars dictaminis</i> of Bernard of Chartres of the 12th <span class="correction" title="omitted a superfluous (">century</span>.
Among special works on formularies are: E. de RoziÃ¨re, <i>Recueil
gÃ©nÃ©ral des formules usitÃ©es dans l&rsquo;empire des Francs</i> (3 vols., Paris,
1861-1871); K. Zeumer, <i>Formulae Merovingici et Karolini aevi</i>
(Hanover, 1886); and L. Rockinger, <i>Briefsteller und FormelbÃ¼cher
des 11 bis. 14 Jahrhunderts</i> (Munich, 1863-1864).</p>

<p><i>Organization.</i>&mdash;The formalities observed by the different
chanceries of medieval Europe, which are to be learned from a
study of the documents issued by them, are so varied and often so
minute, that it is impossible to give a full account of them within
the limits of the present article. We can only state some of the
results of the investigations of students of diplomatic.</p>

<p>The chancery which stands first and foremost is the papal
chancery. On account of its antiquity and of its steady development,
it has served as a model for the other chanceries
of Europe. Organized in remote times, it adopted for
<span class="sidenote">Papal Chancery.</span>
the structure of its letters a number of formulas and
rules which developed and became more and more fixed and
precise from century to century. The Apostolic court being
organized from the first on the model of the Roman imperial
court, the early pontiffs would naturally have collected their
archives, as the emperors had done, into <i>scrinia</i>. Pope Julius I.,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 337-353, reorganized the papal archives under an official
<i>schola notariorum</i>, at the head of which was a <i>primicerius
notariorum</i>. Pope Damasus, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 366-384, built a record office
at the Lateran, <i>archivium sanctae Romanae ecclesiae</i>, where the
archives were kept and registers of them compiled. The collection
and orderly arrangement of the archives provided material
for the establishment of regular diplomatic usages, and the
science of formulae naturally followed.</p>

<p>For the study of papal documents four periods have been
defined, each successive period being distinguished from its
predecessor by some particular development of forms and
procedure. The first period is reckoned from the earliest times to
the accession of Leo IX., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1048. For almost the whole of the
first eight centuries no original papal documents have survived.
But copies are found in canonical works and registers, many
of them false, and others probably not transcribed in full or in
the original words; but still of use, as showing the growth of
formulas. The earliest original document is a fragment of a letter
of Adrian I., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 788. From that date there is a series, but the
documents are rare to the beginning of the 11th century, all down
to that period being written on papyrus. The latest existing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
papyrus document in France is one of Sergius IV., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1011; in
Germany, one of Benedict VIII., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1022. The earliest document
on vellum is one of John XVIII., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1005. The nomenclature
of papal documents even at an early period is rather wide.
In their earliest form they are Letters, called in the documents
themselves, <i>litterae</i>, <i>epistola</i>, <i>pagina</i>, <i>scriptum</i>, sometimes <i>decretum</i>.
A classification, generally accepted, divides them into: 1. Letters
or Epistles: the ordinary acts of correspondence with persons
of all ranks and orders; including constitutions (a later term) or
decisions in matters of faith and discipline, and encyclicals giving
directions to bishops of the whole church or of individual
countries. 2. Decrees, being letters promulgated by the popes
of their own motion. 3. Decretals, decisions on points of
ecclesiastical administration or discipline. 4. Rescripts (called in
the originals <i>preceptum</i>, <i>auctoritas</i>, <i>privilegium</i>), granting requests
to petitioners. But writers differ in their terms, and such subdivisions
must be more or less arbitrary. The comprehensive term
&ldquo;bull&rdquo; (the name of the leaden papal seal, <i>bulla</i>, being transferred
to the document) did not come into use until the 13th century.</p>

<p>Copies of papal deeds were collected into registers or <i>bullaria</i>.
Lists showing the chronological sequence of documents are
catalogues of acts. When into such lists indications from
narrative sources are introduced they become <i>regesta</i> (<i>res gestae</i>):
a term not to be confused with &ldquo;register.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clearness and conciseness have been recognized as attributes
of early papal letters; but even in those of the 4th century certain
rhythmical periods have been detected in their composition which
became more marked under Leo the Great, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 440-461, and
which developed into the <i>cursus</i> or prose rhythm of the pontifical
chancery of the 11th and 12th centuries.</p>

<p>In the most ancient deeds the pope styles himself <i>Episcopus</i>,
sometimes <i>Episcopus Catholicae Ecclesiae</i>, or <i>Episcopus Romanae
Ecclesiae</i>, rarely <i>Papa</i>. Gregory I, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 590, was the first to
adopt the form <i>Episcopus, servus servorum Dei</i>, which became
general in the 9th century, and thenceforth was invariable.</p>

<p>The second period of papal documents extends from Leo IX. to
the accession of Innocent III., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1048-1198. At the beginning
of the period formulae tended to take more definite shape and to
become fixed. In the superscription of bulls a distinction arose:
those which conferred lasting privileges employing the words <i>in
perpetuum</i> to close this clause; those whose benefaction was of
a transitory character using the form of salutation, <i>salutem et
apostolicam benedictionem</i>. But it was under Urban II., <span class="sc">a.d.</span>
1088-1099, that the principal formulae became stereotyped.
Then the distinction between documents of lasting, and those of
transitory, value became more exactly defined; the former class
being known as greater bulls, <i>bullae majores</i> (also called <i>privilegia</i>),
the latter lesser bulls, <i>bullae minores</i>. The leading characteristics
of the greater bulls were these: The first line containing the
superscription and closing with the words <i>in perpetuum</i> (or, sometimes,
<i>ad perpetuam</i>, or <i>aeternam</i>, <i>rei memoriam</i>) was written in
tall and slender ornamental letters, close packed; the final
clauses of the text develop with tendency to fixity; the pope&rsquo;s
subscription is accompanied with the <i>rota</i> on the left and the
<i>benevalete</i> monogram on the right; and certain elaborate forms
of dating are punctiliously observed. The introduction of
subscriptions of cardinals as witnesses had gradually become a
practice. Under Victor II., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1055-1057, the practice became
more confirmed, and after the time of Innocent II., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1130-1145,
the subscriptions of the three orders were arranged according
to rank, those of the cardinal bishops being placed in the
centre under the papal subscription, those of the priests under the
<i>rota</i> on the left, and those of the deacons under the <i>benevalete</i> on
the right. In the lesser bulls simpler forms were employed;
there was no introductory line of stilted letters; the salutation,
<i>salutem et apostolicam benedictionem</i>, closed the superscription;
the final clauses were shortened; there was neither papal subscription,
nor <i>rota</i>, nor <i>benevalete</i>; the date was simple.</p>

<p>From the time of Adrian I., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 772-795, the system of double
dating was followed in the larger bulls. The first date was written
by the scribe of the document, <i>scriptum per manum N.</i> with the
month (rarely the day of the month) and year of the indiction.
The second, the actual date of the execution of the deed, was
entered (ostensibly) by some high official,<i> data</i>, or <i>datum, per
manum N.</i>, and contained the day of the month (according to the
Roman calendar), the year of indiction, the year of pontificate
(in some early deeds, also the year of the empire and the post-consulate
year), and the year of the Incarnation, which, however,
was gradually introduced and only became more common in the
course of the 11th century. For example, a common form of a full
date would run thus: <i>Datum Laterani, per manum N., sanctae
Romanae ecclesiae diaconi cardinalis, xiiii. kl. Maii, indictione V.,
anno dominicae Incarnationis mxcvii., pontificatus autem domini
papae Urbani secundi XÂº</i>. The simpler form of the date of a
lesser bull might be: <i>Datum Laterani, iii. non. Jan., pontificatus
nostri anno iiii</i>.</p>

<p>By degrees the use of the lesser bulls almost entirely superseded
that of the greater bulls, which became exceptional in the 13th
century and almost ceased after the migration to Avignon in 1309.
In modern times the greater bulls occasionally reappear for very
solemn acts, as <i>bullae consistoriales</i>, executed in the consistory.</p>

<p>The third period of papal documents extends from Innocent III.
to Eugenius IV., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1198-1431. The pontificate of Innocent
III. was a most important epoch in the history of the development
of the papal chancery. Formulas became more exactly fixed,
definitions more precise, the observation of rules and precedents
more constant. The staff of the chancery was reorganized. The
existing series of registers of papal documents was then commenced.
The growing use of lesser bulls for the business of the
papal court led to a further development in the 13th century.
They were now divided into two classes: <i>Tituli</i> and <i>Mandamenta</i>.
The former conferred favours, promulgated precepts, judgments,
decisions, &amp;c. The latter comprised ordinances, commissions, &amp;c.,
and were executive documents. There are certain features which
distinguish the two classes. In the <i>tituli</i>, the initial letter of the
pope&rsquo;s name is ornamented with openwork and the other letters
are stilted. In the <i>mandamenta</i>, the initial is filled in solid and
the other letters are of the same size as the rest of the text. In
the <i>tituli</i>, enlarged letters mark the beginnings of the text and of
certain clauses; but not in the <i>mandamenta</i>. In the former the
mark of abbreviation is a looped sign; in the latter it is a
horizontal stroke. In the former the old practice of leaving a gap
between the letters s and t, and c and t, whenever they occur
together in a word (<i>e.g.</i> <i>is te</i>, <i>sanc tus</i>), and linking them by
a coupling stroke above the line is continued; in the latter it
disappears. The leaden bulla attached to a <i>titulus</i> (as a permanent
deed) is suspended by cords of red and yellow silks; while that of
a <i>mandamentum</i> (a temporary deed) hangs from a hempen cord.</p>

<p>In the fourth period, extending from 1431 to the present time,
the <i>tituli</i> and <i>mandamenta</i> have continued to be the ordinary
documents in use; but certain other kinds have also arisen.
Briefs (<i>brevia</i>), or apostolic letters, concerning the personal affairs
of the pope or the administration of the temporal dominion, or
conceding indulgences, came into general use in the 13th century
in the pontificate of Eugenius IV. They are written in the italic
hand on thin white vellum; and the name of the pope with his
style as <i>papa</i> is written at the head of the sheet, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Eugenius
papa iiii</i>. They are closed and sealed with Seal of the Fisherman,
<i>sub anulo Piscatoris</i>. Briefs have almost superseded the
<i>mandamenta</i>. The documents known as Signatures of the court of
Rome or Latin letters, and used principally for the expedition of
indulgences, were first introduced in the 15th century. They were
drawn in the form of a petition to the pope, which he granted by
the words <i>fiat ut petatur</i> written across the top. They were not
sealed; and only the pontifical year appears in the date. Lastly,
the documents to which the name of <i>Motu proprio</i> is given are also
without seal and are used in the administration of the papal court,
the formula <i>placet et ita motu proprio mandamus</i> being signed by
the pope.</p>

<p>The character of the handwriting employed by the papal
chancery is discussed in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Palaeography</a></span>. Here it will
be enough to state that the early style was derived from the
Lombardic hand, and that it continued in use down to the
beginning of the 12th century; but that, from the 10th century,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
owing to the general adoption of the Caroline minuscule writing,
it began to fall and gradually became so unfamiliar to the uninitiated,
that, while it still continued in use for papal bulls, it was
found necessary to accompany them with copies written in the
more intelligible Caroline script. The intricate, fanciful character,
known as the <i>Litera sancti Petri</i>, was invented in the time
of Clement VIII., <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1592-1605, was fully developed under
Alexander VIII., 1689-1691, and was only abolished at the end of
the year 1878 by Leo XIII.</p>

<p>Of the chancery of the Merovingian line of kings as many as
ninety authentic diplomas are known, and, of these, thirty-seven
are originals, the earliest being of the year 625. The
most ancient examples were written on papyrus, vellum
<span class="sidenote">Merovingian chancery.</span>
superseding that material towards the end of the 7th
century. All these diplomas are technically letters,
having the superscription and address and, at the foot, close
to the seal, the valedictory <i>benevalete</i>. They commence with a
monogrammatic invocation, which, together with the superscription
and address written in fanciful elongated letters, occupies the
first line. The superscription always runs in the form, <i>N.
rex Francorum</i>. The most complete kinds of diplomas were
authenticated by the king&rsquo;s subscription, that of the <i>referendarius</i>
(the official charged with the custody of the royal seal), the
impression of the seal, and exceptionally by subscriptions of
prelates and great personages. The royal subscription was
usually autograph; but, if the sovereign were too young or too
illiterate to write, a monogram was traced by the scribe. The
referendary, if he countersigned the royal subscription, added the
word <i>optulit</i> to his own signature; if he subscribed independently,
he wrote <i>recognovit et subscripsit</i>, the end of the last word being
usually lost in flourishes forming a <i>ruche</i>. The date gave the
place, day, month and year of the reign. The Merovingian royal
diplomas are of two classes: (1) Precepts, conferring gifts,
favours, immunities and confirmations, entitled in the documents
themselves as <i>praeceptum</i>, <i>praeceptio</i>, <i>auctoritas</i>; some drawn up
in full form, with preamble and ample final clauses; others less
precise and formal. (2) Judgments (<i>judicia</i>), which required no
preamble or final clauses as they were records of the sovereign&rsquo;s
judicial decisions; they were subscribed by the referendary and
were sealed with the royal seal. Other classes of documents were
the <i>cartae de mundeburde</i>, taking persons under the royal protection,
and <i>indiculi</i> or letters transmitting orders or notifying
decisions; but no examples have survived.</p>

<p>The diplomas of the early Carolingians differed, as was natural,
but little from those of their predecessors. As mayors of the
palace, Charles Martel and Pippin took the style of
<i>vir inluster</i>. On becoming king, Pippin retained it;
<span class="sidenote">Carolingian chancery.</span>
<i>Pippinus, vir inluster, rex Francorum</i>, and it continued
to be part of the royal title till Charlemagne became
emperor. The royal subscription was in form of a sign-manual
or mark, but Charlemagne elaborated this into a monogram of
the letters of his name built up on a cross. In 775 the royal title
of Charlemagne became <i>Carolus, gratia Dei rex Francorum et
Langobardorum, ac patricius Romanorum</i>, the last words being
assumed on his visit to Rome in 774. On becoming emperor in
800, he was styled <i>Imperator, Romanum gubernans imperium, rex
Francorum et Langobardorum</i>. It is to be noticed that thenceforth
his name was spelt with initial K (as it was on the monogram),
having previously been written with C in the deeds. Most of his
diplomas were authenticated by the subscription of the chancellor
and impression of the seal. A novelty in the form of dating was
also introduced, two words, <i>datum</i> (for time) and <i>actum</i> (for
place), being now employed. The character of the writing of the
diplomas, founded on the Roman cursive hand, which had
become very intricate under the Merovingians, improved under
their successors, yet the reform which was introduced into the
literary script hardly affected the cursive writing of diplomatic
until the latter part of Charlemagne&rsquo;s reign. The archaic style
was particularly maintained in judgments, which were issued
by the private chancery of the palace, a department more conservative
in its methods than the imperial chancery. It was in
the reign of Louis Debonair, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 814-840, that the Carolingian
diploma took its final shape. A variation now appears in the
monogram, that monarch&rsquo;s sign-manual being built up, not on a
cross as previously, but on the letter H., the initial of his name
Hludovicus, and serving as the pattern for successive monarchs of
the name of Louis.</p>

<p>In the Carolingian chancery the staff was exclusively ecclesiastical;
at its head was the chancellor, whose title is traced back
to the <i>cancellarius</i>, or petty officer under the Roman empire,
stationed at the bar or lattice (<i>cancelli</i>) of the basilica or other law
court and serving as usher. As keeper of the royal archives
his subscription was indispensable for royal acts. The diplomas
were drawn up by the notaries, an important body, upon whom
devolved the duty of maintaining the formulae and traditions of
the office. It has been observed that in the 9th century the
documents were drawn carefully, but that in the 10th century
there was a great degeneration in this respect. Under the early
Capetian kings there was great confusion and want of uniformity
in their diplomas; and it was not until the reign of Louis VI.,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1108, that the formulae were again reduced to rules.</p>

<p>The acts of the imperial chancery of Germany followed the
patterns of the Carolingian diplomas, with little variation down
to the reign of Frederick Barbarossa, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1152-1190.
The sovereign&rsquo;s style was <i>N. divina favente clementia
rex</i>;
<span class="sidenote">Imperial German chancery.</span>
after coronation at Rome he became <i>imperator
augustus</i>. At the end of the 10th century, Otto III.
developed the latter title into <i>Romanorum imperator augustus</i>.
Under Henry III., and regularly from the time of Henry V., <span class="sc">a.d.</span>
1106-1125, the title before coronation has been <i>Romanorum rex</i>.
The royal monogram did not necessarily contain all the letters of
the name; but, on the other hand, from the year 976, it became
more complicated and combined the imperial title with the name.
For example, the monogram of Henry II. combines the words
<i>Henricus Romanorum imperator augustus</i>. The flourished <i>ruches</i>
also, as in the Frankish chanceries, were in vogue. Eventually
they were used by certain of the chancellors as a sign-manual and
took fanciful shapes, such as a building with a cupola, or even a
diptych. They disappear early in the 12th century, the period
when in other respects the chancery of the Holy Roman Empire
largely adopted a more simple style in its diplomas. Lists of
witnesses, in support of the royal and official subscriptions, were
sometimes added in the course of the 11th century, and they
appear regularly in documents a hundred years later.</p>

<p>For the study of diplomatic in England, material exists in two
distinct series of documents, those of the Anglo-Saxon period, and
those subsequent to the Norman Conquest. The Anglo-Saxon
kings appear to have borrowed, partially, the
<span class="sidenote">Diplomatic in England.</span>
style of their diplomas from the chanceries of their
Frankish neighbours, introducing at the same time
modifications which give those documents a particular character
marking their nationality. In some of the earlier examples we
find that the lines of the foreign style are followed more or less
closely; but very soon a simpler model was adopted which, while
it varied in formulas from reign to reign, lasted in general construction
down to the time of the Norman Conquest. The royal
charters were usually drawn up in Latin, sometimes in Anglo-Saxon,
and began with a preamble or exordium (in some instances
preceded by an invocation headed with the chrismon or with a
cross), in the early times of a simple character, but, later, drawn
out not infrequently to great length in involved and bombastic
periods. Then immediately followed the disposing or granting
clause, often accompanied with a few words explaining the motive,
such as, for the good of the soul of the grantor; and the text was
closed with final clauses of varying extent, protecting the deed
against infringement, &amp;c. In early examples the dating clause
gave the day and month (often according to the Roman calendar)
and the year of the indiction; but the year of the Incarnation was
also immediately adopted; and, later, the regnal year also. The
position of this clause in the charter was subject to variation.
The subscriptions of the king and of the personages witnessing
the deed, each preceded by a cross, but all written by the hand
of the scribe, usually closed the charter. A peculiarity was the
introduction, in many instances, either in the body of the charter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>
or in a separate paragraph at the end, of the boundaries of the
land granted, written in the native tongue. The sovereigns of
the several kingdoms of the Heptarchy, as well as those of the
United Kingdom, usually styled themselves <i>rex</i>. But from the
time of Ã†thelstan, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 825-840, they also assumed fantastic
titles in the text of their charters, such as: <i>rex et primicerius</i>, <i>rex
et rector</i>, <i>gubernator et rector</i>, <i>monarchus</i>, and particularly the Greek
<i>basileus</i>, and <i>basileus industrius</i>. At the same time the name of
Albion was also frequently used for Britain.</p>

<p>A large number of documents of the Anglo-Saxon period, dating
from the 7th century, has survived, both original and copies
entered in chartularies. Of distinct documents there are nearly
two hundred; but a large proportion of these must be set aside
as copies (both contemporary and later) or as spurious deeds.</p>

<p>Although there is evidence, as above stated, of the use of seals
by certain of the Mercian kings, the method of authentication of
diplomas by seal impression was practically unknown to the
Anglo-Saxon sovereigns, save only to Edward the Confessor, who,
copying the custom which obtained upon the continent, adopted
the use of a great seal.</p>

<p>With the Norman Conquest the old tradition of the Anglo-Saxons
disappeared. The Conqueror brought with him the
practice of the Roman chancery, which naturally followed the
Capetian model; and his diplomas of English origin differed only
from those of Normandy by the addition of his new style, <i>rex
Anglorum</i>, in the superscription. But even from the first there
was a tendency to simplicity in the new English chancery, not
improbably suggested by the brief formalities of Anglo-Saxon
charters, and, side by side with the more formal royal diplomas,
others of shorter form and less ceremony were issued, which by
the reign of Henry II. quite superseded the more solemn documents.
These simpler charters began with the royal superscription,
the address, and the salutation, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Willelmus, Dei gratia rex
Anglorum, N. episcopo et omnibus baronibus et fidelibus suis
Francis et Anglis salutem</i>. Then followed the notification and the
grant, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Sciatis me concessisse</i>, &amp;c., generally without final
clauses, or, if any, brief clauses of protection and warranty; and,
at the end, the list of witnesses and the date. The regnal year
was usually cited; but the year of the Incarnation was also
sometimes given. The great seal was appended. To some of the
Conqueror&rsquo;s charters his subscription and those of his queen and
sons are attached, written by the scribe, but accompanied with
crosses which may or may not be autograph. By the reign of
John the simpler form of royal charters had taken final shape,
and from this time the acts of the kings of England have been
classified under three heads: viz. (1) Charters, generally of the
pattern described above; (2) Letters patent, in which the address
is general, <i>Universis presentes litteras inspecturis</i>, &amp;c.; the corroborative
clause describes the character of the document, <i>In
cujus rei testimonium has literas nostras fieri fecimus patentes</i>; the
king himself is his own witness, <i>Teste me ipso</i>; and the great seal
is appended; (3) Close letters, administrative documents conveying
orders, the king witnessing, <i>Teste me ipso</i>.</p>

<p>The style of the English kings down to John was, with few
exceptions, <i>Rex Anglorum</i>; thenceforward, <i>Rex Angliae</i>. Henry
II. added the feudal titles, <i>dux Normannorum et Aquitanorum et
comes Andegavorum</i>, which Henry III. curtailed to <i>dux Aquitaniae</i>.
John added the title <i>dominus Hiberniae</i>; Edward III., on claiming
the crown of France, styled himself rex <i>Angliae et Franciae</i>,
the same title being borne by successive kings down to the year
1801; and Henry VIII., in 1521, assumed the title of <i>fidei
defensor</i>. The formula <i>Dei gratia</i> does not consistently accompany
the royal title until the reign of Henry II., who adopted it in 1173
(see L. Delisle, <i>MÃ©moire sur la chronologie des chartes de Henri II.</i>,
in the <i>Bibl. de l&rsquo;Ã‰cole des Chartes</i>, lxvii. 361-401).</p>

<p>The forms adopted in the royal chanceries were naturally
imitated in the composition of private deeds which in all countries
form the mass of material for historical and diplomatic
research. The student of English diplomatic will soon
<span class="sidenote">Private deeds.</span>
remark how readily the private charters, especially
conveyances of real property, fall into classes, and how
stereotyped the phraseology and formulae of each class become,
only modified from time to time by particular acts of legislation.
The brevity of the early conveyances is maintained through
successive generations, with only moderate growth as time
progresses through the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries. The
different kinds of deeds which the requirements of society have
from time to time called into existence must be learned by the
student from the text-books. But a particular form of document
which was especially in favour in England should be mentioned.
This was the chirograph (Gr. <span class="grk" title="cheir">&#967;&#949;&#943;&#961;</span>, a hand, <span class="grk" title="graphein">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to write),
which is found even in the Anglo-Saxon period, and which got its
name from the word <i>chirographum</i>, <i>cirographum</i> or <i>cyrographum</i>
being written in large letters at the head of the deed. At first the
word was written, presumably, at the head of each of the two
authentic copies which the two parties to a transaction would
require. Then it became the habit to use the word thus written
as a tally, the two copies of the deed being written on one sheet,
head to head, with the word between them, which was then cut
through longitudinally in a straight, or more commonly waved or
indented (<i>in modum dentium</i>) line, each of the two copies thus
having half of the word at the head. Any other word, or a series
of letters, might thus be employed; and more than two copies
of a deed could thus be made to tally. The chirograph was the
precursor of the modern indenture, the commonest form of
English deeds, though no longer a tally. In other countries, the
notarial instrument has performed the functions which the
chirograph and indenture have discharged for us.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIPPEL, JOHANN KONRAD<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (1673-1734), German theologian
and alchemist, son of a Lutheran pastor, was born at the castle of
Frankenstein, near Darmstadt, on the 10th of August 1673. He
studied theology at Giessen. After a short visit to Wittenberg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
he went to Strassburg, where he lectured on alchemy and chiromancy,
and occasionally preached. He gained considerable
popularity, but was obliged after a time to quit the city, owing to
his irregular manner of living. He had up to this time espoused
the cause of the orthodox as against the pietists; but in his two
first works, published under the name &ldquo;Christianus Democritus,&rdquo;
<i>Orthodoxia Orthodoxorum</i> (1697) and <i>Papismus vapulans Protestantium</i>
(1698), he assailed the fundamental positions of the
Lutheran theology. He held that religion consisted not in dogma
but exclusively in love and self-sacrifice. To avoid persecution
he was compelled to wander from place to place in Germany,
Holland, Denmark and Sweden. He took the degree of doctor

<p><span class="bold">DIPTERA<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (<span class="grk" title="dis">&#948;&#943;&#962;</span>, double, <span class="grk" title="ptera">&#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#940;</span>, wings), a term (first employed
in its modern sense by Linnaeus, <i>Fauna Suecica</i>, 1st
ed., 1746, p. 306) used in zoological classification for one of the
Orders into which the <i>Hexapoda</i>, or Insecta, are divided. The
relation of the Diptera (two-winged flies, or flies proper) to the
other Orders is dealt with under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hexapoda</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of the Diptera is expressed in the name
of the Order, since, with the exception of certain aberrant and
apterous forms, flies possess but a single pair of membranous
wings, which are attached to the meso-thorax. Wing-covers and
hind-wings are alike absent, and the latter are represented by a
pair of little knobbed organs, the halteres or balancers, which
have a controlling and directing function in flight. The other
structural characters of the Order may be briefly summarized
as:&mdash;mouth-parts adapted for piercing and sucking, or for
suction alone, and consisting of a proboscis formed of the labium,
and enclosing modifications of the other usual parts of the mouth,
some of which, however, may be wanting; a thorax fused into
a single mass; and legs with five-jointed tarsi. The wings, which
are not capable of being folded, are usually transparent, but
occasionally pigmented and adorned with coloured spots,
blotches or bands; the wing-membrane, though sometimes
clothed with minute hairs, seldom bears scales; the wing-veins,
which are of great importance in the classification of Diptera,
are usually few in number and chiefly longitudinal, there being
a marked paucity of cross-veins. In a large number of Diptera
an incision in the posterior margin of the wing, near the base,
marks off a small lobe, the posterior lobe or alula, while connected
with this but situated on the thorax itself there is a pair of
membranous scales, or squamae, which when present serve to
conceal the halteres. The antennae of Diptera, which are also
extremely important in classification, are thread-like in the more
primitive families, such as the <i>Tipulidae</i> (daddy-long-legs), where
they consist of a considerable number of joints, all of which
except the first two, and sometimes also the last two, are similar
in shape; in the more specialized families, such as the <i>Tabanidae</i>
(horse-flies), <i>Syrphidae</i> (hover-flies) or <i>Muscidae</i> (house-flies,
blue-bottles and their allies), the number of antennal joints is
greatly reduced by coalescence, so that the antennae appear to
consist of only three joints. In these forms, however, the third
joint is really a complex, which in many families bears in addition
a jointed bristle (arista) or style, representing the terminal joints
of the primitive antenna. Although in the case of the majority
of Diptera the body is more or less clothed with hair, the hairy
covering is usually so short that to the unaided eye the insects
appear almost bare; some forms, however, such as the bee-flies
(<i>Bombylius</i>) and certain robber-flies (<i>Asilidae</i>) are conspicuously
hairy. Bristles are usually present on the legs, and in the case of
many families on the body also; those on the head and thorax
are of great importance in classification.</p>

<p>Between 40,000 and 50,000 species of Diptera are at present
known, but these are only a fraction of those actually in existence.
The species recognized as British number some 2700, but to this
total additions are constantly being made. As a rule flies are of
small or moderate size, and many, such as certain blood-sucking
midges of the genus <i>Ceratopogon</i>, are even minute; as extremes
of size may be mentioned a common British midge, <i>Ceratopogon
varius</i>, the female of which measures only 1Â¼ millimetre, and the
gigantic <i>Mydaidae</i> of Central and South America as well as certain
Australian robber-flies, which have a body 1Â¾ in. long, with a
wing-expanse of 3Â¼ in. In bodily form Diptera present two main
types, either, as in the case of the more primitive and generalized
families, they are gnat- or midge-like in shape, with slender
bodies and long, delicate legs, or else they exhibit a more or less
distinct resemblance to the common house-fly, having compact
and stoutly built bodies and legs of moderate length. Diptera
in general are not remarkable for brilliancy of coloration; as a
rule they are dull and inconspicuous in hue, the prevailing body-tints
being browns and greys; occasionally, however, more
especially in species (<i>Syrphidae</i>) that mimic Hymenoptera, the
body is conspicuously banded with yellow; a few are metallic,
such as the species of <i>Formosia</i>, found in the islands of the East
Indian Archipelago, which are among the most brilliant of all
insects. The sexes in Diptera are usually alike, though in a
number of families with short antennae the males are distinguished
by the fact that their eyes meet together (or nearly so) on the
forehead. Metamorphosis in Diptera is complete; the larvae are
utterly different from the perfect insects in appearance, and,
although varying greatly in outward form, are usually footless
grubs; those of the <i>Muscidae</i> are generally known as maggots.
The pupa either shows the appendages of the perfect insect,
though these are encased in a sheath and adherent to the body,
or else it is entirely concealed within the hardened and contracted
larval integument, which forms a barrel-shaped protecting
capsule or puparium.</p>

<p>Diptera are divided into some sixty families, the exact classification
of which has not yet been finally settled. The majority
of authors, however, follow Brauer in dividing the order into
two sections, Orthorrhapha and Cyclorrhapha, according to the
manner in which the pupa-case splits to admit of the escape of the
perfect insect. The general characteristics of the pupae in these
two sections have already been described.</p>

<p>In the Orthorrhapha, in the pupae of which the appendages
of the perfect insect are usually visible, the pupa-case generally
splits in a straight line down the back near the cephalic end; in
front of this longitudinal cleft there may be a small transverse
one, the two together forming a T-shaped fissure. In the
Cyclorrhapha on the other hand, in which the actual pupa is
concealed within the hardened larval skin, the imago escapes
through a circular orifice formed by pushing off or through the
head end of the puparium. The Diptera Orthorrhapha include
the more primitive and less specialized families such as the
<i>Tipulidae</i> (daddy-long-legs), <i>Culicidae</i> (gnats or mosquitoes),
<i>Chironomidae</i> (midges), <i>Mycetophilidae</i> (fungus-midges), <i>Tabanidae</i>
(horse-flies), <i>Asilidae</i> (robber-flies), &amp;c. The Diptera
Cyclorrhapha on the other hand consist of the most highly
specialized families, such as the <i>Syrphidae</i> (hover-flies), <i>Oestridae</i>
(bot and warble flies), and <i>Muscidae</i> (<i>sensu latiore</i>&mdash;the house-fly
and its allies, including tsetse-flies, flesh-flies, <i>Tachininae</i>, or flies
the larvae of which are internal parasites of caterpillars, &amp;c).
It is customary to divide the Orthorrhapha into the two divisions
Nematocera and Brachycera, in the former of which the antennae
are elongate and in a more or less primitive condition, as described
above, while in the latter these organs are short, and, as already
explained, apparently composed of only three joints.</p>

<p>Within the divisions named&mdash;Orthorrhapha Nematocera,
Orthorrhapha Brachycera and Cyclorrhapha&mdash;the constituent
families are usually grouped into a series of &ldquo;superfamilies,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
distinguished by features of structure or habit. Certain extremely
aberrant Diptera, which, in consequence of the adoption of a
parasitic mode of life, have undergone great structural modification,
are further remarkable for their peculiar mode of reproduction,
on account of which the families composing the group are
often termed Pupipara. In these forms the pregnant female,
instead of laying eggs, as Diptera usually do, or even producing
a number of minute living larvae, gives birth at one time but to
a single larva, which is retained within the oviduct of the mother
until adult, and assumes the pupal state immediately on extrusion.
The Pupipara are also termed Eproboscidea (although they
actually possess a well-developed and functional proboscis), and
by some dipterists the Eproboscidea are regarded as a suborder
and contrasted as such with the rest of the Diptera, which are
styled the suborder Proboscidea. By other writers Proboscidea
and Eproboscidea are treated as primary divisions of the
Cyclorrhapha. In reality, however, the families designated
Eproboscidea (<i>Hippoboscidae</i>, <i>Braulidae</i>, <i>Nycteribiidae</i> and
<i>Streblidae</i>), are not entitled to be considered as constituting either
a suborder, or even a main division of the Cyclorrhapha; they
are simply Cyclorrhapha much modified owing to parasitism, and
in view of the closely <span class="correction" title="amended from similiar">similar</span> mode of reproduction in the tsetse-flies
the special designation Pupipara should be abandoned.
Before leaving the subject of classification it may be noted in
passing that in 1906 Professor Lameere, of Brussels, proposed a
scheme for the classification of Diptera which as regards both the
limits of the families and their grouping into higher categories
differs considerably from that in current use.</p>

<p>Little light on the relationship and evolution of the various
families of Diptera is afforded by fossil forms, since as a rule the
latter are readily referable to existing families. With the exception
of a few species from the Solenhofen lithographic Oolite,
fossil Diptera belong to the Tertiary Period, during which
the members of this order attained a high degree of development.
In amber, as proved by the deposits on the shores of the Baltic,
the proverbial &ldquo;fly&rdquo; is more numerous than any other creatures,
and with very few exceptions representatives of all the
existing families have been found. The famous Tertiary beds
at Florissant, Colorado, have yielded a considerable number
<span class="correction" title="amended from or">of</span> remarkably well-preserved <i>Tipulidae</i> (in which family are
included the most primitive of existing Diptera), as also species
belonging to other families, such as <i>Mycetophilidae</i> and even
<i>Oestridae</i>.</p>

<p>Diptera as an order are probably more widely distributed over
the earth&rsquo;s surface than are the representatives of any similar
division of the animal kingdom. Flies seem capable of adapting
themselves to extremes of cold equally as well as to those of heat,
and species belonging to the order are almost invariably included
in the collections brought back by members of Arctic expeditions.
Others are met with in the most isolated localities; thus the
Rev. A. E. Eaton discovered on the desolate shores of Kerguelen&rsquo;s
Island apterous and semi-apterous Diptera (<i>Tipulidae</i> and
<i>Ephydridae</i>) of a degraded type adapted to the climatic peculiarities
of the locality. Many bird parasites belonging to the
<i>Hippoboscidae</i> have naturally been carried about the world by
their hosts, while other species, such as the house-fly, blow-fly and
drone-fly, have in like manner been disseminated by human
agency. Most families and a large proportion of genera are
represented throughout the world, but in some cases (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Glossina</i>&mdash;see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tsetse-Fly</a></span>) the distribution of a genus is limited to a
continent. As a rule the general <i>facies</i> as well as dimensions are
remarkably uniform throughout a family, so that tropical species
often differ little in appearance from those inhabiting temperate
regions. Many instances of exaggerated and apparently unnatural
structure nevertheless occur, as in the case of the genera
<i>Pangonia</i>, <i>Nemestrina</i>, <i>Achias</i>, <i>Diopsis</i> and the family <i>Celyphidae</i>,
and, as might be expected, it is chiefly in tropical species that
these peculiarities are found. To a geographical distribution of
the widest extent, Diptera add a range of habits of the most
diversified nature; they are both animal and vegetable feeders,
an enormous number of species acting, especially in the larval
state, as scavengers in consuming putrescent or decomposing
matter of both kinds. The phytophagous species are attached to
various parts of plants, dead or alive; and the carnivorous in like
manner feed on dead or living flesh, or its products, many larvae
being parasitic on living animals of various classes (in Australia
the larva of a species of <i>Muscidae</i> is even a parasite of frogs),
especially the caterpillars of Lepidoptera, which are destroyed in
great numbers by <i>Tachininae</i>. The recent discovery of a bloodsucking
maggot, which is found in native huts throughout the
greater part of tropical and subtropical Africa, and attacks the
inmates when asleep, is of great interest.</p>

<p>It may confidently be asserted that, of insects which directly
or indirectly affect the welfare of man, Diptera form the vast
majority, and it is a moot point whether the good effected by
many species in the rapid clearing away of animal and vegetable
impurities, and in keeping other insect enemies in check, counterbalances
the evil and annoyance wrought by a large section of the
Order. The part played by certain blood-sucking Diptera in the
dissemination of disease is now well known (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mosquito</a></span> and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tsetse-Fly</a></span>), and under the term <i>myiasis</i> medical literature
includes a lengthy recital of instances of the presence of Dipterous
larvae in various parts of the living human body, and the
injuries caused thereby. That Diptera of the type of the common
house-fly are often in large measure responsible for the spread
of such diseases as cholera and enteric fever is undeniable, and
as regards blood-sucking forms, in addition to those to which
reference has already been made, it is sufficient to mention the
vast army of pests constituted by the midges, sand-flies, horse-flies,
&amp;c., from the attacks of which domestic animals suffer
equally with man, in addition to being frequently infested with
the larvae of the bot and warble flies (<i>Gastrophilus</i>, <i>Oestrus</i> and
<i>Hypoderma</i>). Lastly, as regards the phytophagous forms, there
can be no doubt that the destruction of grass-lands by &ldquo;leather-jackets&rdquo;
(the larvae of crane-flies, or daddy-long-legs,&mdash;<i>Tipula
oleracea</i> and <i>T. paludosa</i>), of divers fruits by <i>Ceratitis capitata</i> and
species of <i>Dacus</i>, and of wheat and other crops by the Hessian-fly
(<i>Mayetiola destructor</i>) and species of <i>Oscinis</i>, <i>Chlorops</i>, &amp;c., is of
very serious consequence.</p>

<p>With many writers it is customary to treat the fleas as a sub-order
of Diptera, under the title Aphaniptera or Siphonaptera.
Since, however, although undoubtedly allied to the Diptera, they
must have diverged from the ancestral stem at an early period,
before the existing forms of Diptera became so extremely
specialized, it seems better to regard the fleas as constituting
an independent order (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Flea</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIPTYCH<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="diptychos">&#948;&#953;&#960;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#962;</span>, two-folding), (1) A tablet made
with a hinge to open and shut, used in the Roman empire for
letters (especially love-letters), and official tokens of the commencement
of a consul&rsquo;s, praetor&rsquo;s or aedile&rsquo;s term of office. The
latter variety of diptych was inscribed with the magistrate&rsquo;s name
and bore his portrait, and was issued to his friends and the public
generally. They were made of boxwood or maple. More costly
examples were in cedar, ivory (<i>q.v.</i>), silver or sometimes gold.
They were often sent as New Year gifts.</p>

<p>(2)In the primitive church when the worshippers brought their
own offerings of bread and wine, from which were taken the
Communion elements, the names of the contributors were
recorded on diptychs and read aloud. To these names were early
added those of deceased members of the community whom it was
desired to commemorate. This custom rapidly developed into
a kind of commemoration of saints and benefactors, living and
dead; especially, in each church, were the names of those who
had been its bishops recorded. The custom was maintained until
the lists became so long that it was impossible to read them
through, and the observance in this form had to be abandoned.
The insertion of a name on the diptych, thereby securing the
prayers of the church, was a privilege from which a person could
be excluded on account of suspicion of heresy or by the intrigues
of enemies. His name could, if written, be expunged under
similar circumstances. The names thus written were read from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
the ambo, in which the diptych was kept. The reading of these
names during the canon of the mass gave rise to the term <i>canonization</i>.
By various councils it was ordained that the name of the
pope should always be inserted in the diptych list.</p>

<p>The addition of <i>dates</i> resulted from the custom of recording
baptisms and deaths; and thus the diptych developed into a
calendar and formed the germ of the elaborate system of
festologies, martyrologies and calendars which developed in
the church.</p>

<p>The diptych went by various names in the early church&mdash;mystical
tablets, anniversary books, ecclesiastical matriculation
registers or books of the living. According to the names inscribed,
bishops, the dead or the living, a diptych might be a
<i>diptycha episcoporum</i>, <i>diptycha mortuorum</i> or <i>diptycha vivorum</i>.</p>

<p>In course of time the list of the names swelled to such proportions
that the space afforded by the diptych was insufficient. A
third fold was consequently provided, and the tablet became a
<i>triptych</i> (though the name <i>diptych</i> was retained as a general term
for the object). Further room was afforded by the insertion of
leaves of parchment or wood between the folds. The custom of
reading names from the diptychs died out about the 8th century.
The diptychs, however, were retained as altar ornaments. From
the original consular documents onwards, the outsides of the
folds had always been richly ornamented, and when they ceased
to be of immediate practical use they became merely decorative.
Instead of the list of names the inside was ornamented
like the outer, and in the middle ages the best painters of the
day would often paint them. When folded, the portraits
of the donor and his wife might be shown; when open there
would be three paintings, one on each fold, of a religious
character.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIRECTORS,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> in company law, the agents by whom a trading
or public company acts, the company itself being a legal abstraction
and unable to do anything. As joint-stock companies
have multiplied and their enterprise has extended, the position of
directors has become one of increasing influence and importance.
It is they who control the colossal funds now invested in trading
companies, and who direct their policy (for shareholders are
seldom more than dividend-drawers). Upon their uprightness,
vigilance and sound judgment depends the welfare of the greatest
part of the trade of the country concerned. It is not to be
wondered at that in view of this influence and independence of
action the law courts have held directors to a strict standard
of duty, and that the parliament of the United Kingdom has
singled out directors from other agents for special legislation in
the Directors Liability Act 1890, the Larceny Act 1861, the
Companies Act 1867 and the Winding-up Act 1890.</p>

<p>The first directors of a company are generally appointed by the
articles of association. Their consent to act must now, under the
Companies Act 1908, be filed with the registrar of joint-stock companies.
Directors other than the first are elected at the annual
general meeting, a certain proportion of the acting directors&mdash;usually
one-third&mdash;retiring under the articles by rotation each
year, and their places being filled up by election. A share qualification
is nearly always required, on the well-recognized principle
that a substantial stake in the undertaking is the best guarantee
of fidelity to the company&rsquo;s interests. A director once appointed
cannot be removed during his term of office by the shareholders,
unless there is a special provision for that purpose in the articles
of association; but a company may dismiss a director if the
articles&mdash;as is usually the case&mdash;authorize dismissal. The
authority and powers of directors are prima facie those necessary
for carrying on the ordinary business of the company, but it is
usual to define the more important of such powers in the articles
of association. For instance, it is commonly prescribed how and
when the directors may make calls, to what amount they may
borrow, how they may invest the funds of the company, in what
circumstances they may forfeit shares, or veto transfers, in what
manner they shall conduct their proceedings, and what shall
constitute a quorum of the board. Whenever, indeed, specific
directions are desirable they may properly be given by the articles.
But superadded to and supplementing these specific powers there
is usually inserted in the articles a general power of management
in terms similar to those of clause 55 of the model regulations for
a company, known as Table A (clause 71 of the revised Table).
The powers, whether general or specific, thus confided to directors
are in the nature of a trust, and the directors must exercise them
with a single eye to the benefit of the company. For instance, in
allotting shares they must consult the interests of the company,
not favour their friends. So in forfeiting shares they must not use
the power collusively for the purpose of relieving the shareholder
from liability. To do so is an abuse of the power and a fraud on
the other shareholders.</p>

<p>It would give a very erroneous idea of the position and functions
of directors to speak of them&mdash;as is sometimes done&mdash;as trustees.
They are only trustees in the sense that every agent is. They are
&ldquo;commercial men managing a trading concern for the benefit of
themselves and the other shareholders.&rdquo; They have to carry on
the company&rsquo;s business, to extend and consolidate it, and to do
this they must have a free hand and a large discretion to deal with
the exigencies of the <span class="correction" title="amended from commerical">commercial</span> situation. This large discretion
the law allows them so long as they keep within the limits set
by the company&rsquo;s memorandum and articles. They are not to be
held liable for mere errors of judgment, still less for being defrauded.
That would make their position intolerable. All that
the law requires of them is that they should be faithful to their
duties as agents&mdash;&ldquo;diligent and honest,&rdquo; to use the words of Sir
George Jessel, formerly master of the rolls. Thus in the matter of
diligence it is a director&rsquo;s duty to attend as far as possible all
meetings of the board; at the same time non-attendance, unless
gross, will not amount to negligence such as to render a director
liable for irregularities committed by his co-directors in his
absence. A director again must not sign cheques without informing
himself of the purpose for which they are given. A director,
on the same principle, must not delegate his duties to others unless
expressly authorized to do so, as where the company&rsquo;s articles
empower the directors to appoint a committee. Directors may,
it is true, employ skilled persons, such as engineers, valuers or
accountants, to assist them, but they must still exercise their
judgment as business men on the materials before them. Then in
the matter of honesty, a director must not accept a present in cash
or shares or in any other form whatever from the company&rsquo;s
vendor, because such a present is neither more nor less than a bribe
to betray the interests of the company, nor must he make any
profit in the matter of his agency without the knowledge and
consent of his principal, the company. He must not, in other
words, put himself in a position in which his duty to the company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
and his own interest conflict or even may conflict. This rule often
comes into play in the case of contracts between a company and a
director. There is nothing in itself invalid in such a contract, but
the onus is on the director if he would keep such a contract to
show that the company assented to his making a profit out of the
contract, and for that purpose he must show that he made full and
fair disclosure to the company of the nature and extent of his
interest under the contract. It is for this reason that when a
company&rsquo;s vendor is also a director he does not join the board
until his co-directors have exercised an independent judgment on
the propriety of the purchase.</p>

<p>A director must also bear in mind&mdash;what is a fundamental
principle of company management&mdash;that the funds of the
company are entrusted to the directors for the objects of the
company as defined by the company&rsquo;s memorandum of association
and authorized by the general law, and that they must not be
diverted from those objects or applied to purposes which are outside
the objects of the company, <i>ultra vires</i>, as it is commonly
called, or outside the powers of management given by the shareholders
to the directors. This does not abridge the large discretion
allowed to directors in carrying on the business of the
company. The funds embarked in a trading company are
intended to be employed for the acquisition of gain, and risk,
greater or less according to circumstances, is necessarily incidental
to such employment; but it is quite another matter when
directors pay dividends out of capital, or return capital to the
shareholders, or spend money of the company in &ldquo;rigging&rdquo; the
market, or in buying the company&rsquo;s shares or paying commission
for underwriting the shares of the company except where such
commission is authorized under acts of 1900 and 1907, incorporated
in the Companies Act 1908. Directors who in these or
any other ways misapply the funds of the company are guilty
of what is technically known as &ldquo;misfeasance&rdquo; or breach
of trust, and all who join in the misapplication are jointly and
severally liable to replace the sums so misapplied. The remedy of
the company for misfeasance, if the company is a going concern,
is by action against the delinquent directors; but where a
company is being wound up, the legislature has, under the
Winding-up Act 1890, provided a summary mode of proceeding,
by which the official receiver or liquidator, or any creditor or
contributory of the company, may take out what is known as a
misfeasance summons, to compel the delinquent director or officer
to repay the misapplied moneys or make compensation. The
departmental committee of the Board of Trade in its report (July
1906) recommended that the court should be given a discretionary
power, analogous to that it already possesses in the case of
trustees under the Judicial Trustees Act 1896, s. 3, to relieve a
director (or a promoter) in certain cases from liability. This
recommendation has been given effect to by s. 279 of the
Companies Act 1908, which provides that, &ldquo;If in any proceeding
against a director of a company for negligence or breach of trust
it appears to a court that the director is or may be liable in respect
of the negligence or breach of trust, but has acted honestly and
reasonably and ought fairly to be excused for the negligence
or breach of trust, the court may relieve him either wholly or
partly from his liability on such terms as the court may think
proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Directors who circulate a prospectus containing statements
which they know to be false, with intent to induce any person
to become a shareholder, may be prosecuted under Â§ 84 of the
Larceny Act 1861. They are also liable criminally for falsification
of the company&rsquo;s books, and for this or any other criminal offence
the court in winding up may, on the application of the liquidator,
direct a prosecution. As to the liability of directors for statements
or omissions in a prospectus see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Company</a></span>.</p>

<p>In managing the affairs of the company directors must meet
together and act as a body, for the company is entitled to their
collective wisdom in council assembled. Board meetings are held
at such intervals as the directors think expedient. Notice of the
meeting must be given to all directors who are within reach, but
the notice need not specify the particular business to be transacted.
The articles usually fix, or give the directors power to fix,
what number shall constitute a quorum for a board meeting.
They also empower the directors to elect a chairman of the board.
The directors exercise their powers by a resolution of the board
which is recorded in the directors&rsquo; minute-book.</p>

<p>The court will not as a rule interfere with the discretion of
directors honestly exercised in the management of the affairs of
the company. The directors have prima facie the confidence of
the shareholders, and it is not for the court to say that such confidence
is misplaced. If the stockholders are dissatisfied with
the management the remedy is in their own hands&mdash;they can
call a meeting and elect a new board.</p>

<p>A company&rsquo;s articles usually provide for the payment of a
certain sum to each director for his services during the year.
When this is the case it is an authority to the directors to pay
themselves the amount of such remuneration. The remuneration,
unless otherwise expressly provided, covers all expenses incidental
to the directors&rsquo; duties. A director, for instance, cannot claim to
be paid in addition to his fixed remuneration his travelling
expenses for attending board meetings.</p>

<p>When a company winds up, the directors&rsquo; powers of management
come to an end. Their agency is superseded in favour of
that of the liquidator.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIRECTORY,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> a term meaning literally that which guides or
directs, and so applied to a book or set of rules giving directions
for public worship. The <i>directorium</i> or <i>ordo</i> of the Roman Church
contains regulations as to the Mass and office to be used on each
day throughout the year, and the word is found in the <i>Directory
for the Publick Worship of God</i> drawn up in 1644 at the Westminster
Assembly. The term now usually signifies a book containing
the names, addresses and occupations, &amp;c. of the inhabitants
of a town or district, or of a similar list of the users of a telephone
supply, or of the members of a particular profession or trade.
The name <i>Directoire</i> or Directory was given to the body which
held the executive power in France from October 1795 until
November 1799 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">French Revolution</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIRGE,<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> a song or hymn of mourning, particularly one sung at
funerals or at a Service in commemoration of the dead. It is
derived from the first word of the antiphon <i>&rdquo;Dirige, Domine,
Deus meus, in conspectu tuo viam meam&rdquo;</i> (Guide, O Lord, my
God, my way in Thy sight), of the opening psalm in the office for
the dead in the Roman Church. The antiphon is adapted from
verse 8 of Psalm v.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIRK,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> a dagger, particularly the heavy dagger carried by the
Highlanders of Scotland. The dirk as worn in full Highland
costume is an elaborately ornamented weapon, with cairngorms
or other stones set in the head of the handle, which has no guard.
Inserted in the sheath there may be two small knives. The dirk,
in the shape of a straight blade, with a small guard, some 18 in.
long, is worn by midshipmen in the British navy. The origin of
the word is doubtful. The earlier forms were <i>dork</i> and <i>durk</i>, and
the spelling <i>dirk</i>, adopted by Johnson, represents the pronunciation
of the second form. The name seems to have been early
applied to the daggers of the Highlanders, but the Gaelic word is
<i>biodag</i>, and the Irish <i>duirc</i>, often stated to be the origin, is only an
adaptation of the English word. It may be a corruption of the
German <i>Dolch</i>, a dagger. The suggestion that it is an application
of the Christian name &ldquo;Dirk,&rdquo; the short form of &ldquo;Dieterich,&rdquo; is
not borne out, according to the <i>New English Dictionary</i>, by any
use of this name for a dagger, and is further disproved by the
earlier English spelling.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIRSCHAU,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Prussia,
province of West Prussia, on the left bank of the Vistula, 20 m. S.
from Danzig and at the junction of the important lines of railway
Berlin-KÃ¶nigsberg and Danzig-Bromberg. Pop. (1905) 14,185.
It has a Roman Catholic and a Protestant church and several
schools. The river is here crossed by two fine iron bridges. The
older structure dating from the year 1857, originally used for the
railway, is now given up to road traffic, and the railway carried
by a new bridge completed in 1891. Dirschau has railway workshops
and manufactories of sugar, agricultural implements and
cement. During the war with Poland, Gustavus Adolphus made
it his headquarters for many months after its capture in 1626.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DISABILITY,<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> a term meaning, in general, want of ability, and
used in law to denote an incapacity in certain persons or classes of
persons for the full enjoyment of duties or privileges, which, but
for their disqualification, would be open to them; hence, legal
disqualification. Thus, married women, persons under age,
insane persons, convicted felons are under disability to do certain
legal acts. This disability may be absolute, wholly disabling the
person so long as it continues, or partial, ceasing on discontinuation
of the disabling state, as attainment of full age.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DISCHARGE<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (adapted from the O. Fr. <i>descharge</i>, modern
<i>dÃ©charge</i>, from a med. Lat. <i>discargare</i>, to unload, <i>dis-</i> and <i>carricare</i>,
to load, cf. &ldquo;charge&rdquo;), a word meaning relief from a load or
burden, hence applied to the unloading of a ship, the firing of
a weapon, the passage of electricity from an electrified body,
the issue from a wound, &amp;c. From the sense of relief from an
obligation, &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; is also applied to the release of a soldier
or sailor from military or naval service, or of the crew of a
merchant vessel, or to the dismissal from an office or situation.
In law, it is used of a document or other evidence that can be
accepted as proof of the release from an obligation, as of a receipt,
on payment of money due. Similarly it is applied to the release
in accordance with law of a person in custody on a criminal
charge, and to the legal release of a bankrupt from further
liability for debts provable in the bankruptcy except those
incurred by fraud or debts to the crown. It is also applied to the
reversal of an order of a court. In the case of divorce, where the
rule <i>nisi</i> is not made absolute, the rule is said to be discharged.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DISCHARGING ARCH,<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> in architecture, an arch built over a
lintel or architrave to take off the superincumbent weight. The
earliest example is found in the Great Pyramid, over the lintels of
the entrance passage to the tomb: it consisted of two stones only,
resting one against the other. The same object was attained in
the Lion Gate and the tomb of Agamemnon, both in Mycenae, and
in other examples in Greece, where the stones laid in horizontal
courses, one projecting over the other, left a triangular hollow
space above the lintel of the door, which was subsequently filled
in by vertical sculptured stone panels. The Romans frequently
employed the discharging arch, and inside the portico of the
Pantheon the architraves have such arches over them. In
the Golden Gateway of the palace of Diocletian at Spalato the
discharging arches, semicircular in form, were adopted as architectural
features and decorated with mouldings. The same is
found in the synagogues in Palestine of the 2nd century; and
later, in Byzantine architecture, these moulded archivolts above
an architrave constitute one of the characteristics of the style.
In the early Christian churches in Rome, where a colonnade
divided off the nave and aisles, discharging arches are turned in
the frieze just above the architraves.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DISCIPLE,<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> properly a pupil, scholar (Lat. <i>discipulus</i>, from
<i>discere</i>, to learn, and root seen in <i>pupillus</i>), but chiefly used of
the personal followers of Jesus Christ, including the inner circle
of the Apostles (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DISCIPLES OF CHRIST,<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Christians</span>, an American Protestant
denomination, founded by Thomas Campbell, his son
Alexander Campbell (<i>q.v.</i>) and Barton Warren Stone (1772-1844).
Stone had been a Presbyterian minister prominent in the
Kentucky revival of 1801, but had been turned against sectarianism
and ecclesiastical authority because the synod had condemned
Richard McNemar, one of his colleagues in the revival, for
preaching (as Stone himself had done) counter to the Westminster
Confession, on faith and the work of the Holy Spirit in conversion.
He had organized the Springfield Presbytery, but in 1804 with his
five fellow ministers signed &ldquo;The Last Will and Testament of the
Springfield Presbytery,&rdquo; giving up that name and calling themselves
&ldquo;Christians.&rdquo; Like Stone, Alexander Campbell had
adopted (in 1812) immersion, and, like him, his two great desires
were for Christian unity and the restoration of the ancient order
of things. But the Campbellite doctrines differed widely from the
hyper-Calvinism of the Baptists whom they had joined in 1813,
especially on the points on which Stone had quarrelled with
the Presbyterians; and after various local breaks in 1825-1830,
when there were large additions to the Restorationists from
the Baptist ranks, especially under the apostolic fervour and
simplicity of the preaching of Walter Scott (1796-1861), in 1832
the Reformers were practically all ruled out of the Baptist communion.
The Campbells gradually lost sight of Christian unity,
owing to the unfortunate experience with the Baptists and to the
tone taken by those clergymen who had met them in debates;
and for the sake of Christian union it was peculiarly fortunate
that in January 1832 at Lexington, Kentucky, the followers of
the Campbells and those of Stone (who had stressed union more
than primitive Christianity) united. Campbell objected to the
name &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; as sectarianized by Stone, but &ldquo;Disciples&rdquo;
never drove out of use the name &ldquo;Christians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the Civil War the denomination escaped an actual
scission by following the neutral views of Campbell, who opposed
slavery, war and abolition. In 1849 the American Christian
Missionary Society was formed; it was immediately attacked as a
&ldquo;human innovation,&rdquo; unwarranted by the New Testament, by
literalists led in later years by Benjamin Franklin (secretary of the
missionary society in 1857), who opposed all church music also.
Isaac Errett (1820-1888) was the most prominent leader of the
progressive party, which was considered corrupt and worldly
by the literalists, many of whom, in spite of his efforts, broke off
from the main body, especially in Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Arkansas and Texas.</p>

<p>The main body appointed in 1890 a standing committee on
Christian union; their aim in this respect is not for absorption,
as was clearly shown by their answer in 1887 to overtures from
the Protestant Episcopal Church regarding Christian unity. The
credal position of the Disciples is simple: great stress is put upon
the phrase &ldquo;the Christ, the Son of the living God,&rdquo; and upon the
recognition by Jesus of this confession as the foundation of His
church; as to baptism, agreement with Baptists is only as to the
mode, immersion; this is considered &ldquo;the primitive confession
of Christ and a gracious token of salvation,&rdquo; and as being &ldquo;for
the remission of sins&rdquo;; the Disciples generally deny the authority
over Christians of the Old Covenant, and Alexander Campbell in
particular held this view so forcibly that he was accused by
Baptists of &ldquo;throwing away the Old Testament.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s
Supper is celebrated every Sunday, the bread being broken by
the communicants. The Disciples are not Unitarian in fact or
tendency, but they urge the use of simple New Testament
phraseology as to the Godhead. Their church government is
congregational.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The growth of the denomination has been greatest in the states
along the Ohio river, whence they have spread throughout the Union.
In 1908 there were 6673 ministers and 1,285,123 communicants in the
United States. There are churches in Canada, in Great Britain and
in Australia. Bethany College, at Bethany, West Virginia, was
chartered in 1840, and Alexander Campbell, who had founded it as
Buffalo Seminary, was its president until his death in 1866; other
colleges founded by the sect are: Kentucky University, Lexington,
Ky.; Hiram College, Hiram, Ohio (1850, until 1867 known as
Western Reserve Eclectic Institute); Butler College, Indianapolis,
Indiana (1855); Christian University, Canton, Missouri (1851;
coeducational); Eureka College, in Woodford county, Illinois (1855;
coeducational); Union Christian College, Merom, Ind. (1859);
Texas Christian University, Waco, Texas (1873, founded as Add
Ran College at Thorpe&rsquo;s Springs, removing to Waco in 1895); Drake

Ky. Theological seminaries are the Berkeley Bible Seminary,
Berkeley, California (1896); the Disciples&rsquo; Divinity House, Chicago,
Ill. (1894); and the Eugene Divinity School, Eugene, Oregon
(1895). &ldquo;Bible chairs&rdquo; were established in state universities and
elsewhere by the Disciples,&mdash;at the University of Michigan (1893),
at the University of Virginia (1899), at the University of Calcutta
(1900) and at the University of Kansas (1901). The denomination has

<p><span class="bold">DISCLAIMER,<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> a renunciation, denial or refusal; a disavowal
of claims. In law the term is used more particularly in the
following senses:&mdash;(1) In the law of landlord and tenant, the direct
repudiation of that relation by some act on the part of the tenant.
A disclaimer may be verbal or written, but in such case it must be
something more than a mere renunciation of the tenant&rsquo;s title, or
it may be an act which is wholly inconsistent with the existence of
such relation, as the setting up by the tenant of a distinct title
either in himself or some third party. (2) In the law of bankruptcy,
where any part of the property of a bankrupt consists of
land of any tenure burdened with onerous covenants, of stocks or
shares in companies, of unprofitable contracts, or of any property
that is unsaleable, or not readily saleable, by reason of its binding
the possessor to the performance of any onerous act, the trustee,
notwithstanding that he has endeavoured to sell or has taken
possession of the property, or exercised any act of ownership in
relation to it, may, subject to certain provisions, by writing signed
by him, at any time within twelve months after the first appointment
of a trustee, &ldquo;disclaim&rdquo; the property (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bankruptcy</a></span>).
(3) In the law of trusts, disclaimer is the refusal or renunciation of
the office or duties of a trustee. It is an undisputed rule that no
one is compellable to undertake a trust, so that as soon as a person
knows he has been appointed a trustee under some instrument, he
should determine whether he will accept the office or not. Disclaimer
of trust should be by deed, as admitting of no ambiguity,
but it may be by conveyance to other accepting trustees, or orally,
or by written declaration, or even by conduct. (4) In the law of
patents, disclaimer is the renunciation, by amendment of specifications,
of the portion of an inventor&rsquo;s claim to protection.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DISCOVERY,<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> in law, the revealing or disclosing of any matter.
The English common law courts were originally unable to compel
a litigant before a trial to disclose the facts and documents on
which he relied. In equity, however, a different rule prevailed,
there being an absolute right to discovery of all material facts on
which a case was founded. Now the practice is regulated by the
Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, Order 31. Discovery is of two
kinds, namely, by interrogatories and by affidavit of documents,
provision being also made for the production and inspection of
documents. Where a party to a suit can make an affidavit
stating that in his belief certain specified documents are or have
been in the possession of some other party, the court may make an
order that such party state on affidavit whether he has or ever had
any of those documents in his possession, or if he has parted with
them or what has become of them. A further application may
then be made by notice to the party who has admitted possession
of the documents for production and inspection. Copies also may
be taken of the more important documents. There is also discovery
of facts obtained by means of interrogatories, <i>i.e.</i> written
questions addressed on behalf of one party, before trial, to the
other party, who is bound to answer them in writing upon oath.
In order to prevent needless expense the party seeking discovery
must first secure the cost of it by paying into court a sum of
money, generally not less than five pounds. See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Evidence</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DISCUS<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="diskos">&#948;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, disk), a circular plate of stone, later of
metal, which was used by the ancient Greeks for throwing to a
distance as a gymnastic exercise. Judging from specimens found
by excavators, the ancient discus was about 8 or 9 in. in diameter
and weighed from 4 to 5 &#8468;, although one of bronze, preserved
in the British Museum, weighs over 8 &#8468;. Sometimes a kind of
quoit, spherical in form, was used, through a hole in which a thong
was passed to assist the athlete in throwing it. The sport of
throwing the discus was common in the time of Homer, who
mentions it repeatedly. It formed a part of the <i>pentathlon</i>, or
quintuple games, in the ancient Olympic Games. Statius, in
<i>Thebais</i>, 646-721, fully describes the use of the discus. In the
British Museum there is a restored copy of a statue by Myron
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, Plate IV. fig. 68) of a discus-thrower (<i>discobolus</i>)
in the act of hurling the missile; but the investigations of N. E.
Norman Gardiner show that a wrong attitude has been adopted
by the restorer.</p>

<p>Throwing the discus was introduced as an event in modern
athletics at the revived Olympic Games, first held at Athens in
1896, and since that time it has become a recognized event in the
athletic championship meetings of several European nations, as
well as in the United States, where it has become very popular.
According to the American rules the discus must be of a smooth,
hard-wood body without finger-holes, weighted in the centre with
lead disks and capped with polished brass disks, with a steel ring
on the outside. Its weight must be 4Â½ &#8468;, its outside diameter
8 in. and its thickness at the centre 2 in. It must be thrown from
a 7-ft. circle, which may not be overstepped in throwing, and the
throw is measured from the spot where the discus first strikes the
ground to the point in the circumference of the circle on a line
between the centre and the point of striking.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DISINFECTANTS,<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> substances employed to neutralize the action
of pathogenic organisms, and prevent the spread of contagious or
infectious disease. The efficiency of any disinfectant is due to
its power of destroying, or of rendering inert, specific poisons or
disease germs. Therefore antiseptic substances generally are to
this extent disinfectants. So also the deodorizers, which act
by oxidizing or otherwise changing the chemical constitution of
volatile substances disseminated in the air, or which prevent
noxious exhalations from organic substances, are in virtue of
these properties effective disinfectants in certain diseases. A
knowledge of the value of disinfectants, and the use of some of the
most valuable agents, can be traced to very remote times; and
much of the Levitical law of cleansing, as well as the origin of
numerous heathen ceremonial practices, are clearly based on a
perception of the value of disinfection. The means of disinfection,
and the substances employed, are very numerous, as are the
classes and conditions of disease and contagion they are designed
to meet. Nature, in the oxidizing influence of freely circulating
atmospheric air, in the purifying effect of water, and in the
powerful deodorizing properties of common earth, has provided
the most potent ever-present and acting disinfecting media. Of
the artificial disinfectants employed or available three classes may
be recognized:&mdash;1st, volatile or vaporizable substances, which
attack impurities in the air; 2nd, chemical agents, for acting on
the diseased body or on the infectious discharges therefrom; and
3rd, the physical agencies of heat and cold. In some of these
cases the destruction of the contagium is effected by the formation
of new chemical compounds, by oxidation, deoxidation or other
reaction, and in others the conditions favourable to life are
removed or life is destroyed by high temperature. Among the
first class, aerial or gaseous disinfectants, formic aldehyde has
of late years taken foremost place. The vapour is a powerful
disinfectant and deodorant, and for the surface disinfection of
rooms, fulfils all requirements when used in sufficient amount.
It acts more rapidly than equal quantities of sulphurous acid, and
it does not affect colours. It is non-poisonous, though irritating
to the eyes and throat. With the exception of iron and steel it
does not attack metals. It can be obtained in paraform tabloids,
and with a specially constructed spirit lamp disinfection can be
carried out by any one. Twenty tabloids must be employed for
every 1000 cubic ft. of space. Disinfection by sulphurous acid
fumes is of great antiquity, and is still in very general use; for
the purpose of destroying vermin it is more powerful than formic
aldehyde. Camphor and some volatile oils have also been
employed as air disinfectants, but their virtues lie chiefly in
masking, not destroying, noxious effluvia. In the 2nd class&mdash;non-gaseous
disinfecting compounds&mdash;all the numerous antiseptic
substances may be reckoned; but the substances principally employed
in practice are oxidizing agents, as potassium manganates
and permanganates, &ldquo;Condy&rsquo;s fluid,&rdquo; and solutions of the so-called
&ldquo;chlorides of lime,&rdquo; soda and potash, with the chlorides of
aluminium and zinc, soluble sulphates and sulphites, solutions of
sulphurous acid, and the tar products&mdash;carbolic, cresylic and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
salicylic acids. Of the physical agents heat and cold, the latter,
though a powerful natural disinfectant, is not practically available
by artificial means; heat is a power chiefly relied on for purifying
and disinfecting clothes, bedding and textile substances generally.
Different degrees of temperature are required for the destruction
of the virus of various diseases; but as clothing, &amp;c., can be
exposed to a heat of about 250Â° Fahr. without injury, provision is
made for submitting articles to nearly that temperature. For the

<p><span class="bold">DISMAL,<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> an adjective meaning dreary, gloomy, and so a name
given to stretches of swampy land on the east coast of the United
States, as the Dismal Swamp in Virginia and North Carolina.
The derivation has been much discussed. In the early examples
of the use the word is a substantive, especially in the expression
&ldquo;in the dismal,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> in the dismal time or days. Later
it became adjectival, especially in combination with &ldquo;days.&rdquo; It
has been connected with &ldquo;decimal,&rdquo; med. Latin <i>decimalis</i>,
belonging to a tithe or tenth, and thus the &ldquo;dismal days&rdquo; are the
unpleasant days connected with the extortion and oppression
of exacting payment of tithes. According to the <i>New English
Dictionary</i>, quoting Professor W. W. Skeat, &ldquo;dismal&rdquo; is derived,
through an Anglo-Fr. <i>dis mal</i>, from the Lat. <i>dies mali</i>, evil or
unpropitious days. This Anglo-French expression, explained as
<i>les mal jours</i>, is found in a MS. of Rauf de Linham&rsquo;s <i>Art de
Kalender</i>, 1256. These days of evil omen were known as <i>Dies
Aegyptiaci</i> (Du Cange, <i>Glossarium, s.v.</i>) or Egyptian days, either
as having been instituted by Egyptian astrologers or with reference
to the &ldquo;ten plagues&rdquo;; so Chaucer, &ldquo;I trowe hit was in
the dismal, That were the ten woundes of Egipte&rdquo; (<i>Book of
the Duchesse</i>, 1206). There were two such days in each month.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DISORDERLY HOUSE,<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> in law, a house in which the conduct of
its inmates is such as to become a public nuisance, or a house
where persons congregate to the probable disturbance of the public
peace or other commission of crime. In England, by the Disorderly
Houses Act 1751, the term includes common bawdy
houses or brothels,<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> common gaming houses, common betting
houses and disorderly places of entertainment. The keeping of
such is a misdemeanour punishable by fine or imprisonment, and
in the case of a brothel also punishable on summary conviction by
the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885; the letting out for gain
for indiscriminate prostitution of a room or rooms in a house will
make it as much a brothel in law as if the whole house were let out
for the purpose. Where, however, a woman occupies a house or
room which is frequented by men for the purpose of committing
fornication with her, she cannot be convicted of keeping a disorderly
house. See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prostitution</a></span>.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1e" id="ft1e" href="#fa1e"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The etymology of this word has been confused by the early
adoption into English usage of the O. Fr. <i>bordel</i>. The two words
are in origin quite distinct. Brothel is an O. Eng. word for a person,
not a place. It meant an abandoned vagabond, one who had gone to
ruin (<i>abrÃ©othan</i>). <i>Bordel</i>, on the contrary, is a place, literally a small
hut or shelter, especially for fornication, Med. Lat. <i>bordellum</i>,
diminutive of the Late Lat. <i>borda</i>, board. The words were early
confused, and brothel-house, bordel-house, bordel or brothel, are all
used for a disorderly house, while bordel was similarly misused, and,
like brothel in its proper meaning, was applied to a disorderly person.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DISPATCH,<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Despatch</span>, to send off immediately, or by
express; particularly in the case of the sending of official
messages, or of the immediate sending of troops to their destination,
or the like. The word is thus used as a substantive of written
official reports of events, battles and the like, sent by ambassadors,
generals, &amp;c., by means of a special messenger, or of express
correspondence generally. From the primary meaning of the
prompt sending of a message, &amp;c., the word is used of the quick
disposal of business, or of the disposal of a person by violence;
hence the word means to execute or murder. The etymology of
the word has been obscured by the connexion with the Fr.
<i>dÃ©pÃªcher</i>, and <i>dÃ©pÃªche</i>, which are in meaning the equivalents of
the Eng. verb and substantive. The Fr. word is made up of the
prefix <i>de-</i>, Lat. <i>dis-</i>, and the root which appears in <i>empÃªcher</i>, to
embarrass, and means literally to disentangle. The Lat. origin
of <i>dÃ©pÃªcher</i> and <i>empÃªcher</i> is a Low Lat. <i>pedicare</i>, <i>pedica</i>, a fetter.
The Fr. word came into Eng. as <i>depeach</i>, which was in use from
the 15th century until &ldquo;despatch&rdquo; was introduced. This word is
certainly direct from the Ital. <i>dispacciare</i>, or Span, <i>despachar</i>,
which must be derived from the Lat. root appearing in <i>pactus</i>,
fixed, fastened, from <i>pangere</i>. The <i>New English Dictionary</i> finds
the earliest instance of &ldquo;dispatch&rdquo; in a letter to Henry VIII.
from Bishop Tunstall, commissioner to Spain in 1516-1517.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DISPENSATION,<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> a term with two main applications, (1) to the
action of administering, arranging or dealing out, and (2) to the
action of allowing certain things, rules, &amp;c., to be done away with,
relaxed. Of these two meanings the first is to be derived from the
classical Latin use of <i>dispensare</i>, literally, to weigh out, hence to
distribute, especially of the orderly arrangement of a household
by a steward; thus <i>dispensatio</i> was, in theology, the word chosen
to translate the Greek <span class="grk" title="oikonomia">&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#945;</span>, economy, <i>i.e.</i> divine or
religious systems, as in the Jewish, Mosaic, Christian dispensations.
Dispensation in law is, strictly speaking, the suspension
by competent authority of general rules of law in particular cases.
Its object is to modify the hardships often arising from the
rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its
essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation, <i>i.e.</i>
making it non-existent, in such cases. It follows, then, that dispensation,
in its strict sense, is anticipative, <i>i.e.</i> it does not absolve
from the consequences of a legal obligation already contracted,
but avoids a breach of the law by suspending the obligation to
conform to it, <i>e.g.</i> a dispensation or licence to marry within the
prohibited degrees, or to hold benefices in plurality. The term is,
however, frequently used of the power claimed and exercised by
the supreme legislative authority of altering or abrogating in
particular cases conditions established under the existing law
and of releasing individuals from obligations incurred under it,
<i>e.g.</i> dispensations granted by the pope <i>ex plenitudine potestatis</i>
from the obligation of celibacy, from religious and other vows,
from <i>matrimonium ratum</i>, <i>non consummatum</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>1. <i>Ecclesiastical Law.</i>&mdash;In the theory of the canon law the
dispensing power is the corollary of the legislative, the authority
that makes laws, and no other, having power to suspend them.
It follows that the law of nature (<i>jus naturae</i>) and <i>a fortiori</i> the
law of God (<i>jus divinum</i>) are not subject to dispensation of any
earthly authority, and that it is only the disciplinary laws made
by the Church that the Church is empowered to suspend or to
abrogate. Thus, not even the pope could grant a dispensation for
a marriage between persons related in the direct line of ascent
or descent, <i>e.g.</i> father and daughter, or between brother and
sister, while dispensations are granted for marriages within
other prohibited degrees, <i>e.g.</i> uncle and niece.</p>

<p>The dispensing power, like the legislative authority, was
formerly invested in general councils and even in provincial
synods; but in the West, with the gradual centralization of
authority at Rome, it became ultimately vested in the pope as
the supreme lawgiver of the Church. Subject, however, to the
supreme jurisdiction of the pope, the power of dispensation continued
to reside in the other organs of the Church in exact
proportion to their legislative capacities, <i>i.e.</i> in provincial synods
in respect of regional rules laid down by them, and in bishops in
respect of rules laid down by them for their dioceses. According
to Du Cange, the earliest record of the use of the word <i>dispensatio</i>
in this connexion is in the letter of Pope Gelasius I. of the 11th
of March 494, to the bishops of Lucania (in JaffÃ©, <i>Reg. Pont. Rom.</i>,
ed. 2, tom. i. no. 636): necessaria rerum Dispensatione constringimur, ...
sic canonum paternorum decreta librare, ...
ut quae praesentium necessitas temporum restaurandis Ecclesiis
relaxanda deposcit, adhibita consideratione diligenti, quantum
fieri potest temperemus.<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Dispensations from the observance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
of traditional rules were, however, during the early centuries
exceedingly rare, and there are more instances of the popes
repudiating than of their exercising the power to grant them.
Thus Celestine I. (d. 432) wrote: &ldquo;The rules govern us, not we
the rules: we are subject to the canons, since we are the servants
of the precepts of the canons&rdquo; (<i>Epist. 3 ad Episcopos Illyrici</i>);
and Pope Zozimus wrote even more strongly: &ldquo;This see
possesses no authority to make any concession or change; for
with us abides antiquity firmly rooted (<i>inconvulsis radicibus</i>),
reverence for which the decrees of the Fathers enjoined.&rdquo; As time
went on, however, and the Church expanded, this rigidly conservative
attitude proved impossible to maintain, and the
principle of &ldquo;tempering&rdquo; the law when forced to do so &ldquo;by
the exigencies of affairs or of the times&rdquo; (<i>rerum vel temporum
angustia</i>), as laid down by Gelasius, was adopted into the canon
law itself. The principle was, of course, singularly open to abuse.
In theory it was laid down from the first that dispensations were
only to be granted in cases of urgent necessity and in the highest
interests of the Church; in practice, from the 11th century
onwards, the power of dispensation was used by the popes as one
of the most potent instruments for extending their influence.
Dispensations to hold benefices in plurality formed, with provisions
and the papal claim to the right of direct appointment, a
powerful means for extending the patronage of the Holy See and
therefore its hold over the clergy, and from the 13th century
onwards this abuse assumed vast proportions (Hinschius iii. p.
250). Even more scandalous was the almost unrestrained traffic
in licences and dispensations at Rome, which grew up, at least
as early as the 14th century, owing to the fees charged for such
dispensations having come to be regarded by the Curia as a
regular source of revenue (Woker, <i>Das kirchliche Finanzwesen der
PÃ¤pste</i>, NÃ¶rdlingen, 1878, pp. 75, 160). Loud complaints of these
abuses were raised in the reforming councils of Constance and
Basel in the 15th century, but nothing was done effectually to
check them.</p>

<p>The actual practice of the Roman Catholic Church is based upon
the decisions of the council of Trent, which left the medieval
theory intact while endeavouring to guard against its abuses.
The proposal put forward by the Gallican and Spanish bishops to
subordinate the papal power of dispensation to the consent of the
Church in general council was rejected, and even the canons of
the council of Trent itself, in so far as they affected reformation
of morals or ecclesiastical discipline, were decreed &ldquo;saving the
authority of the Holy See&rdquo; (<i>Sess.</i> xxv. cap. 21, de ref.). At the
same time it was laid down in respect of all dispensations, whether
papal or other, that they were to be granted only for just and
urgent causes, or in view of some decided benefit to the Church
(urgens justaque causa et major quandoque utilitas), and in all
cases <i>gratis</i>. The payment of money for a dispensation was <i>ipso
facto</i> to make the dispensation void (<i>Sess.</i> xxv. cap. 18, de ref.).</p>

<p>Though verbal dispensations are valid, papal dispensations are
given in writing. Before the constitution <i>Sapienti</i> of Pius X.
(1908) all dispensations in <i>foro externo</i>, especially in matrimonial
causes, were dealt with by the Dataria Apostolica, those <i>in foro
interno</i> by the Penitentiary, which latter also possessed <i>in foro
externo</i> the right to grant dispensations in matrimonial causes
to poor people. Since 1908 the Dataria only deals with dispensations
in matters concerning benefices, dispensations in matrimonial
matters having been transferred to the new Congregation
on the discipline of the sacraments (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Curia Romana</a></span>).</p>

<p>The regular form of dispensation is the <i>forma commissaria</i>
(<i>Trid. Sess.</i> xxii. cap. 5, de ref.), <i>i.e.</i> a mandate to the bishop to
grant the dispensation, after due inquiry, in the pope&rsquo;s name. In
exceptional cases, <i>e.g.</i> sovereigns or bishops, the dispensation is
sent direct to the petitioner (<i>forma gratiosa</i>). Dispensations are
nominally gratuitous; but the officials are entitled to fees for
drawing them up, and there are customary &ldquo;compositions&rdquo;
(<i>compositiones</i>) which are destined for charitable objects in Rome.
These fees were and are regulated according to the capacity of
the petitioners to pay, the result being that the abuses which the
council of Trent had sought to abolish continued to flourish. In
the 17th century a specially privileged class of bankers (<i>banquiers
expÃ©ditionnaires</i>) existed at Rome whose sole business was
obtaining dispensations on commission, and one of these, named
Pelletier, published at Paris in 1677, under the royal <i>imprimatur</i>,
a regular tariff of the sums for which in any given case a dispensation
might be obtained. That the &ldquo;urgent and just cause&rdquo;
was, in the circumstances, a very minor consideration was to be
expected, and the enlightened pope Benedict XIV., himself a
canon lawyer of eminence, complained &ldquo;Dispensationem non
raro concedi in Dataria, sine causa, nempe ob eleemosynam quae
praestatur&rdquo; (Inst. 87, No. 26). It may be added that the worst
abuses of this system have long since disappeared. The bishops
have their own correspondents at Rome, and one of the duties of
the diplomatic representatives of foreign states at the Curia is
to see that their nationals receive their dispensations without
overcharge.</p>

<p>Bishops are by right (<i>jure ordinario</i>) competent to dispense in
all cases expressly reserved to them by the canon law, <i>e.g.</i> in the
matter of publication of banns of marriage. They possess besides
special powers delegated to them by the pope and renewed every
five years (<i>facultates quinquennales</i>), or by virtue of faculties
granted to them personally (<i>facultates extraordinariae</i>), <i>e.g.</i> to
dispense from rules of abstinence, from simple vows, and with
some exceptions from the prohibition of marriage within prohibited
degrees.</p>

<p><i>Church of England.</i>&mdash;By 25 Henry VIII. cap. 21. sec 2 (1534), it
was enacted that neither the king, his successors, nor any of his
subjects should henceforth sue for licences, dispensations, &amp;c.,
to the see of Rome, and that the power to issue such licences,
dispensations, &amp;c., &ldquo;for causes not being contrary or repugnant
to the Holy Scriptures and laws of God,&rdquo; should be vested in the
archbishop of Canterbury for the time being, who at his own
discretion was to issue such dispensations, &amp;c., under his seal,
to the king and his subjects. The power of dispensation thus
vested in the archbishops partly fell obsolete, partly has been
curtailed by subsequent statutes, <i>e.g.</i> the Pluralities Act of 1838.
It is now confined to granting dispensations for holding two
benefices at once, to issuing licences for non-residence, and in
matrimonial cases to the issuing of special licences. The dispensing
power of bishops in the Church of England survives only in
the right to grant marriage licences, <i>i.e.</i> dispensations from the
obligation to publish the banns. Though, however, these licences
and dispensations are given under the archiepiscopal and episcopal
seals, they are actually issued by the commissaries of faculties and
vicars-general (chancellors), independently, in virtue of the powers
conferred on them by their patents. This has led, since the passing
of the Divorce Acts and the Marriage with a Deceased Wife&rsquo;s
Sister Act, to a curiously anomalous position, licences for the
remarriage of divorced persons having been issued under the
bishop&rsquo;s seal, while the bishop himself publicly protested that
such marriages were contrary to &ldquo;the law of God,&rdquo; but that he
himself had no power to prevent his chancellor licensing them.</p>

<p>2. <i>Constitutional Law.</i>&mdash;The power of dispensation from the
operation of the ordinary law in particular cases is, of course,
everywhere inherent in the supreme legislative authority, however
rarely it may be exercised. Divorce (in Ireland) by act of
parliament may be taken as an example which still actually
occurs. On the other hand, the dispensing power once vested in
the crown in England is now merely of historical interest, though
of great importance in the constitutional struggles of the past.
This power possessed by the crown of dispensing with the statute
law is said to have been copied from the dispensations or non
obstante clauses granted by the popes in matters of canon law;
the parallel between them is certainly very striking, and there can
be no doubt that the principles of the canon law influenced the
decisions of the courts in the matter. It was, for instance, very
generally laid down that the king could by dispensation make it
lawful to do what was <i>malum prohibitum</i> but not to do what was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
<i>malum in se</i>, a principle of the canon law, but one difficult to
reconcile with English legal principles, since no act is legally
<i>malum</i> unless forbidden by law. This was pointed out by Chief
Justice Vaughan in the celebrated judgment in the case of <i>Thomas</i>
v. <i>Sorrell</i>, when he rejected the distinction between <i>mala in se</i> and
<i>mala prohibita</i> as confusing, and attempted to define the dispensing
power of the crown by limiting it to cases of individual
breaches of penal statutes where no third party loses a right of
action, and where the breach is not continuous, at the same time
denying the power of the crown to dispense with any general
penal law. This judgment, as Sir William Anson points out, only
showed the extreme difficulty of limiting the power ascribed to the
crown, a standing grievance from the time that parliament had
risen to be a constituent part of the state. So long as the legal
principle by which the law was &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s law&rdquo; survived there
was in fact no theoretical basis for such limitation, and the matter
resolved itself into one of the great constitutional questions
between crown and parliament which issued in the Revolution of
1688. The supreme crisis came owing to the use made by James
II. of the dispensing power. His action in dispensing with the
Test Act, in order to enable Roman Catholics to hold office under
the crown, was supported by the courts in the test case of <i>Godden</i>
v. <i>Hales</i>, but it made the Revolution inevitable. By the Bill of
Rights the exercise of the dispensing power was forbidden, except
as might be permitted by statute. At the same time the legality
of its exercise in the past was admitted by the clause maintaining
the validity of dispensations granted in a certain form before
the 23rd of October 1689.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DISPERSION<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>dispergere</i>, to scatter), the act or
process of separation and distribution. Apart from the technical
use of the term, especially in optics (see below), the expression
particularly applied to the settlements of Jews in foreign
countries outside Palestine. These were either voluntary, for
purposes of trade and commerce, or the results of conquest, such
as the captivities of Assyria and Babylonia. The word <i>diaspora</i>
(Gr. <span class="grk" title="diaspora">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#940;</span>) is also used of these scattered communities, but
is usually confined to the dispersion among the Hellenic and
Roman peoples, or to the body of Christian Jews outside Palestine
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jews</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dispersion</span>, in <span class="sc">Optics</span>. When a beam of light which is not
homogeneous in character, <i>i.e.</i> which does not consist of simple
vibrations of a definite wave-length, undergoes refraction at the
surface of any transparent medium, the different colours corresponding
to the different wave-lengths become separated or
<i>dispersed</i>. Thus, if a ray of white light AO (fig. 1) enters obliquely
into the surface of a block of glass
at O, it gives rise to the divergent
system of rays ORV, varying continuously
in colour from red to
violet, the red ray OR being least
refracted and the violet ray OV
most so. The order of the successive
colours in all colourless transparent
media is red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo and violet. Dispersion
is therefore due to the fact that
rays of different colours possess different
refrangibilities.</p>

<tr><td class="caption sc">Fig. 2.</td></tr></table>

<p>The simplest way of showing dispersion is to refract a narrow
beam of sunlight through a prism of glass or prismatic vessel
containing water or other clear liquid. As the light is twice
refracted, the dispersion is increased, and the rays, after transmission
through the prism, form a divergent system, which may
be allowed to fall on a sheet of white paper, forming the well-known
solar spectrum. This method was employed by Sir Isaac
Newton, whose experiments constitute the earliest systematic
investigation of the phenomenon. Let O (fig. 2) represent a
small hole in the shutter of a darkened room, and OS a narrow
beam of sunlight which is allowed to fall on a white screen so
as to form an image of the sun at S. If now the prism P
be interposed as in the
figure, the whole beam
is not only refracted upward,
but also spread out
into the spectrum RV,
the horizontal breadth of
the band of colours being
the same as that of the
original image S. In an
experiment similar to
that here represented,
Newton made a small hole in the screen and another small hole in
a second screen placed behind the first. By slightly turning the
prism P, the position of the spectrum on the first screen could
be shifted sufficiently to cause light of any desired colour to pass
through. Some of this light also passed through the second hole,
and thus he obtained a narrow beam of practically homogeneous
light in a fixed direction (the line joining the apertures in the two
screens). Operating on this beam with a second prism, he found
that the homogeneous light was not dispersed, and also that it
was more refracted the nearer the point from which it was taken
approached to the violet end of the spectrum RV. This confirmed
his previous conclusion that the rays increase in refrangibility
from red to violet.</p>

<p>Newton also made use of the method of crossed prisms, which
has been found of great use in studying dispersion. The prism P
(fig. 3) refracts upwards, while the prism Q, which has its refracting
edge perpendicular to
that of P, refracts towards
the right. The combined
effect of the two is to produce
a spectrum sloping
up from left to right. The
spectrum will be straight
if the two prisms are similar
in dispersive property, but
if one of them is constructed
of a material which possesses any peculiarity in this
respect it will be revealed by the curvature of the spectrum.</p>

<p>The coloured borders seen in the images produced by simple
lenses are due to dispersion. The explanation of the colours of
the rainbow, which are also due to dispersion, was given by
Newton, although it was known previously to be due to refraction
in the drops of rain (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rainbow</a></span>).</p>

<p>According to the wave-theory of light, refraction (<i>q.v.</i>) is due
to a change of velocity when light passes from one medium to
another. The phenomenon of dispersion shows that in dispersive
media the velocity is different for lights of different wave-lengths.
In free space, light of all wave-lengths is propagated with the same
velocity, as is shown by the fact that stars, when occulted by the
moon or planets, preserve their white colour up to the last
moment of disappearance, which would not be the case if one
colour reached the eye later than another. The absence of colour
changes in variable stars or in the appearance of new stars is
further evidence of the same fact. All material media, however,
are more or less dispersive. In air and other gases, at ordinary
pressures, the dispersion is very small, because the refractivity
is small. The dispersive powers of gases are, however, generally
comparable with those of liquids and solids.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Dispersive Power.</i>&mdash;In order to find the amount of dispersion caused
by any given prism, the deviations produced by it on two rays of any
definite pure colours may be measured. The angle of difference
between these deviations is called the dispersion for those rays.
For this purpose the C and F lines in the spark-spectrum of hydrogen,
situated in the red and blue respectively, are usually employed. If
&delta;<span class="su">F</span> and &delta;<span class="su">C</span> are the angular deviations of these rays, then &delta;<span class="su">F</span> &minus; &delta;<span class="su">C</span> is
called the mean dispersion of the prism. If the refracting angle of the
prism is small, then the ratio of the dispersion to the mean deviation
of the two rays is the dispersive power of the material of the prism.
Instead of the mean deviation, Â½ (&delta;<span class="su">F</span> + &delta;<span class="su">C</span>), it is more usual to take
the deviation of some intermediate ray. The exact position of the
selected ray does not matter much, but the yellow D line of sodium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
is the most convenient. If we denote its deviation by &delta;<span class="su">D</span>, then we
may put</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dispersive power</i> = (&delta;<span class="su">F</span> - &delta;<span class="su">C</span>)/&delta;<span class="su">D</span> &emsp; &emsp; (1).</p>

<p>This quantity may readily be expressed in terms of the refractive
indices for the three colours, for if A is the angle of the prism (supposedly
small)</p>

<p class="center">&delta;<span class="su">C</span> = (&mu;<span class="su">C</span> &minus; 1)A, &delta;<span class="su">D</span> = (&mu;<span class="su">D</span> &minus; 1)A, &delta;<span class="su">F</span> = (&mu;<span class="su">F</span> &minus; 1)A,</p>

<p class="noind">where &mu;<span class="su">C</span>, &mu;<span class="su">D</span>, &mu;<span class="su">F</span> are the respective indices of refraction. This gives
at once</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dispersive power</i> = (&mu;<span class="su">F</span> &minus; &mu;<span class="su">C</span>)/(&mu;<span class="su">D</span> &minus; 1) &emsp; &emsp; (2).</p>

<p>The second of these two expressions is generally given as the
definition of dispersive power. It is more useful than (1), as the
refractive indices may be measured with a prism of any convenient
angle.</p>

<p>By studying the dispersion of colours in water, turpentine and
crown glass Newton was led to suppose that dispersion is proportional
to refraction. He concluded that there could be no
refraction without dispersion, and hence that achromatism was
impossible of attainment (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aberration</a></span>). This conclusion was
proved to be erroneous when Chester M. Hall in 1733 constructed
achromatic lenses. Glasses can now be made differing considerably
both in refractivity and dispersive power.</p>

<p><i>Irrationality of Dispersion.</i>&mdash;If we compare the spectrum produced
by refraction in a glass prism with that of a diffraction grating, we
find not only that the order of colours is reversed, but also that the
same colours do not occupy corresponding lengths on the two spectra,
the blue and violet being much more extended in the refraction
spectrum. The refraction spectra for different media also differ
amongst themselves. This shows that the connexion between the
refrangibility of light and its wave-length does not obey any simple
law, but depends on the nature of the refracting medium. This
property is referred to as the &ldquo;irrationality of dispersion.&rdquo; In a
diffraction spectrum the diffraction is proportional to the wave_length,
and the spectrum is said to be &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; If the increase
of the angle of refraction were proportional to the diminution of
wave-length for a prism of any material, the resulting spectrum
would also be normal. This, however, is not the case with ordinary
refracting media, the refrangibility generally increasing more and
more rapidly as the wave-length diminishes.</p>

<p>The irrationality of dispersion is well illustrated by C. Christiansen&rsquo;s
experiments on the dispersive properties of white powders. If the
powder of a transparent substance is immersed in a liquid of the same
refractive index, the mixture becomes transparent and a measurement
of the refractive index of the liquid gives the refractivity of
the powder. Christiansen found, in an investigation of this kind,
that the refractivity of the liquid could only be got to match that
of the powder for mono-chromatic light, and that, if white light
were used, brilliant colour effects were obtained, which varied in a
remarkable manner when small changes occurred in the refractive
index of the liquid. These effects are due to the difference in dispersive
power of the powder and the liquid. If the refractive index
is, for instance, the same for both in the case of green light, and a
source of white light is viewed through the mixture, the green component
will be completely transmitted, while the other colours are
more or less scattered by multiple reflections and refractions at the
surfaces of the powdered substance. Very striking colour changes
are observed, according to R. W. Wood, when white light is transmitted
through a paste made of powdered quartz and a mixture of
carbon bisulphide with benzol having the same refractive index as
the quartz for yellow light. In this case small temperature changes
alter the refractivity of the liquid without appreciably affecting the
quartz. R. W. Wood has studied the iridescent colours seen when a
precipitate of potassium silicofluoride is produced by adding silicofluoric
acid to a solution of potassium chloride, and found that they
are due to the same cause, the refractive index of the minute crystals
precipitated being about the same as that of the solution, which
latter can be varied by dilution.</p>

<p><i>Anomalous Dispersion.</i>&mdash;In some media the usual order of the
colours is changed. This curious phenomenon was noticed by
W. H. Fox Talbot about 1840, but does not seem to have become
generally known. In 1860 F. P. Leroux discovered that iodine
vapour refracted the red rays more than the violet, the intermediate
colours not being transmitted; and in 1870 Christiansen found that
an alcoholic solution of fuchsine refracted the violet less than the red,
the order of the successive colours being violet, red, orange, yellow;
the green being absorbed and a dark interval occurring between
the violet and red. A. Kundt found that similar effects occur with
a large number of substances, in particular with all those which
possess the property of &ldquo;surface colour,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, which strongly reflect
light of a definite colour, as do many of the aniline dyes. Such
bodies show strong absorption bands in those colours which they
reflect, while of the transmitted light that which is of a slightly
greater wave-length than the absorbed light has an abnormally
great refrangibility, and that of a slightly shorter wave-length an
abnormally small refrangibility. The name given to this phenomenon,&mdash;&ldquo;anomalous
dispersion&rdquo;&mdash;is an unfortunate one, as it has
been found to obey a regular law.</p>

<p>In studying the dispersion of the aniline dyes, a prism with a very
small refracting angle is made of two glass plates slightly inclined
to each other and enclosing a very thin wedge of the dye, which
is either melted between the plates, or is in the form of a solution
retained in position by surface-tension. Only very thin layers are
sufficiently transparent to show the dispersion near or within an
absorption band, and a large refracting angle is not required, the
dispersion usually being very considerable. Another method,
which has been used by R. W. Wood and C. E. Magnusson, is to
introduce a thin film of the dye into one of the optical paths of a
Michelson interferometer, and to determine the consequent displacement
of the fringes. E. Mach and J. Arbes have used a method
depending on total reflection (Drude&rsquo;s <i>Theory of Optics</i>, p. 394).</p>

<p>A very remarkable example of anomalous dispersion, which was
first observed by A. Kundt, is that exhibited by the vapour of sodium.
It has not been found practicable to make a prism of this vapour
in the ordinary way by enclosing it in a glass vessel of the required
shape, as sodium vapour attacks glass, quickly rendering it opaque.
A. E. Becquerel, however, investigated the character of the dispersion
by using prism-shaped flames strongly coloured with sodium.
But the best way of exhibiting the effect is by making use of a
remarkable property of sodium vapour discovered by R. W. Wood
and employed for this purpose in a very ingenious manner. He found
that when sodium is heated in a hard glass tube, the vapour which
is formed is extraordinarily cohesive, only slowly spreading out in
a cloud with well-defined borders, which can be rendered visible by
placing the tube in front of a sodium flame, against which the cloud
appears black. If a long glass tube with plane ends, and containing
some pellets of sodium is heated in the middle by a row of burners,
the cool ends remain practically vacuous and do not become obscured.
The sodium vapour in the middle is very dense on the heated side,
the density diminishing rapidly towards the upper part of the tube,
so that, although not prismatic in form, it refracts like a prism owing
to the variation in density. Thus if a horizontal slit is illuminated
by an arc lamp, and the light-rendered parallel by a collimating
lens&mdash;is transmitted through the sodium tube and focused on the
vertical slit of a spectroscope, the effect of the sodium vapour is to
produce its refraction spectrum
vertically on the slit.
The image of this seen
through the glass prism of
the spectroscope will appear
as in fig. 4. The whole of the
light, with the exception of
a small part in the neighbourhood
of the D lines, is
practically undeviated, so that it illuminates only a very short piece
of the slit and is spread out into the ordinary spectrum. But the
light of slightly greater wave-length than the D lines, being refracted
strongly downward by the sodium vapour, illuminates the bottom of
the slit; while that of slightly shorter wave-length is refracted
upward and illuminates the top of the slit. Fig. 4 represents the inverted
image seen in the
telescope. The light corresponding
to the D lines
and the space between
them is absorbed, as evidenced
by the dark interval.
If the sodium is only
gently heated, so as to
produce a comparatively
rarefied vapour, and a grating
spectroscope employed,
the spectrum obtained is like that shown in fig. 5, which was
the effect noticed by Becquerel with the sodium flame. Here the
light corresponding to the space between the D lines is transmitted,
being strongly refracted upward near D<span class="su">1</span>, and downward near D<span class="su">2</span>.</p>

<p>The theory of anomalous dispersion has been applied in a very
interesting way by W. H. Julius to explain the &ldquo;flash spectrum&rdquo;
seen during a solar eclipse at the moment at which totality occurs.
The conditions of this phenomenon have been imitated in the
laboratory by Wood, and the corresponding effect obtained.</p>

<p><i>Theories of Dispersion.</i>&mdash;The first attempt at a mathematical
theory of dispersion was made by A. Cauchy and published in 1835.
This was based on the assumption that the medium in which the
light is propagated is discontinuous and molecular in character, the
molecules being subject to a mutual attraction. Thus, if one molecule
is disturbed from its mean position, it communicates the
disturbance to its neighbours, and so a wave is propagated.
The formula arrived at by Cauchy was</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">n = A +</td> <td>B</td>
<td rowspan="2">+</td> <td>C</td>
<td rowspan="2">+ ....</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">&lambda;<span class="su">2</span></td> <td class="denom">&lambda;<span class="su">4</span></td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">n being the refractive index, &lambda; the wave-length, and A, B, C, &amp;c.,
constants depending on the material, which diminish so rapidly that
only the first three as here written need be taken into account. If
suitable values are chosen for these constants, the formula can be
made to represent the dispersion of ordinary transparent media
within the visible spectrum very well, but when extended to the
infra-red region it often departs considerably from the truth, and
it fails altogether in cases of anomalous dispersion. There are also
grave theoretical objections to Cauchy&rsquo;s formula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span></p>

<p>The modern theory of dispersion, the foundation of which was laid
by W. Sellmeier, is based upon the assumption that an interaction
takes place between ether and matter. Sellmeier adopted the
elastic-solid theory of the ether, and imagined the molecules to be
attached to the ether surrounding them, but free to vibrate about
their mean positions within a limited range. Thus the ether within
the dispersive medium is loaded with molecules which are forced to
perform oscillations of the same period as that of the transmitted
wave. It can be shown mathematically that the velocity of propagation
will be greatly increased if the frequency of the light-wave is
slightly greater, and greatly diminished if it is slightly less than the
natural frequency of the molecules; also that these effects become
less and less marked as the difference in the two frequencies increases.
This is exactly in accordance with the observed facts in the case
of substances showing anomalous dispersion. Sellmeier&rsquo;s theory did
not take account of absorption, and cannot be applied to calculate
the dispersion within a broad absorption band. H. von Helmholtz,
working on a similar hypothesis, but with a frictional term introduced
into his equations, obtained formulae which are applicable to
cases of absorption. A modified form of Helmholtz&rsquo;s equation, due
to E. Ketteler and known as the Ketteler-Helmholtz formula, has
been much used in calculating dispersion, and expresses the facts
with remarkable accuracy. P. Drude has obtained a similar formula
based on the electromagnetic theory, thus placing the theory of
dispersion on a much more satisfactory basis. The fundamental
assumption is that the medium contains positively and negatively
charged ions or electrons which are acted on by the periodic electric
forces which occur in wave propagation on Maxwell&rsquo;s theory. The
equations finally arrived at are</p>

<p class="noind">where &lambda; is the wave-length in free ether of light whose refractive
index is n, and &lambda;<span class="su">m</span> the wave-length of light of the same period as the
electron, &kappa; is a coefficient of absorption, and D and g are constants.
The sign of summation &Sigma; is used in cases where there are several
absorption bands, and consequently several similar terms on the
right-hand side, each with a different value of &lambda;<span class="su">m</span>. This would occur
if there were several kinds of ions, each with its own natural period.</p>

<p>In a region where there is no absorption, we have &kappa; = 0 and
therefore g = 0, and we have only one equation, namely,</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">nÂ² = 1 + <span class="f150">&Sigma;</span></td> <td>D&lambda;Â²</td>
<td rowspan="2">,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">(&lambda;Â² &minus; &lambda;<span class="su">m</span>Â²)</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">which is identical with Sellmeier&rsquo;s result. As &lambda;<span class="su">m</span>, is a wave-length
corresponding to an absorption band, this formula can be used to
find values of &lambda;<span class="su">m</span> which satisfy the observed values of n within the
region of transparency, and so to determine where the absorption
bands are situated. In this way the existence of bands in the infrared
part of the spectrum has been predicted in the case of quartz
and detected by experiments on the selective reflection of the material.</p>

<p><span class="bold">D&rsquo;ISRAELI<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Disraeli</span>), <span class="bold">ISAAC</span> (1766-1848), English man of
letters, father of the earl of Beaconsfield (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at Enfield
in May 1766. He belonged to a Jewish family which, having been
driven by the Inquisition from Spain, towards the end of the 15th
century, settled as merchants at Venice, and assumed the name
which has become famous; it was generally spelt D&rsquo;Israeli until
the middle of the 19th century. In 1748 his father, Benjamin
D&rsquo;Israeli, then only about eighteen years of age, removed to
England, where, before passing the prime of life, he amassed
a competent fortune, and retired from business. He belonged
to the London congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews,
of which his son also remained a nominal member until after
Benjamin D&rsquo;Israeli died at the end of 1816.</p>

<p>The strongly marked characteristics which determined Isaac
D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s career were displayed to a singular degree even in
his boyhood. He spent his time over books and in long day-dreams,
and evinced the strongest distaste for business and all
the more bustling pursuits of life. These idiosyncrasies met with
no sympathy from either of his parents, whose ambitious plans
for his future career they threatened to disappoint. When he was
about fourteen, in the hope of changing the bent of his mind, his
father sent him to live with his agent at Amsterdam, where he
worked under a tutor for four or five years. Here he studied
Bayle and Voltaire, and became an ardent disciple of Rousseau.
Here also he wrote a long poem against commerce, which he
produced as an exposition of his opinions when, on his return to
England, his father announced his intention of placing him in a
commercial house at Bordeaux. Against such a destiny D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s
mind strongly revolted; and he carried his poem, with a letter
earnestly appealing for advice and assistance, to Samuel Johnson;
but when he called again a week after to receive an answer, the
packet was returned unopened&mdash;the great Doctor was on his
death-bed. He also addressed a letter to Dr Vicesimus Knox,
master of Tonbridge Grammar School, begging to be received into
his family, that he might enjoy the benefit of his learning and
experience. How this application was answered we do not know.
The evident firmness of his resolve, however, was not without
effect. His parents gave up their purpose for a time. He was
sent to travel in France, and allowed to occupy himself as he
wished; and he had the happiness of spending some months in
Paris, in the society of literary men, and devoted to the literary
pursuits in which he delighted.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1788 he returned home, and in the next year
he attacked Peter Pindar (John Wolcot) in <i>The Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> in a poem in the manner of Pope, &ldquo;On the Abuse of
Satire.&rdquo; The authorship of the poem was much debated, and it
was attributed by some to William Hayley, upon whom it was
actually avenged, with characteristic savageness, by its victim.
It is greatly to Wolcot&rsquo;s credit that, on learning his mistake,
he sought the acquaintance of his young opponent, whose friend
he remained to the end of his life. Through the success of this
satire D&rsquo;Israeli made the acquaintance of Henry James Pye, who
helped to persuade his father that it would be a mistake to force
him into a business career, and introduced him into literary circles.
D&rsquo;Israeli dedicated his first book, <i>A Defence of Poetry</i>, to Pye in
1790. Henceforth his life was passed in the way he best liked&mdash;in
quiet and almost uninterrupted study. In 1802 he married Maria
Basevi, by whom he had five children, of whom Benjamin (afterwards
Lord Beaconsfield and Prime Minister of England) was the
second. He was able to maintain his strenuous habits of study
till he reached the advanced age of seventy-two, when he was
forced, by paralysis of the optic nerve, to give up work almost
entirely. He lived ten years longer, and died at his seat at Bradenham
House, Buckinghamshire, on the 19th of January 1848.</p>

<p>Isaac D&rsquo;Israeli is most celebrated as the author of the
<i>Curiosities of Literature</i> (1791, subsequent volumes in 1793, 1817,
1823 and 1834). It is a miscellany of literary and historical
anecdotes, of original critical remarks, and of interesting and
curious information of all kinds, animated by genuine literary
feeling, taste and enthusiasm. With the <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>
may be classed D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s <i>Miscellanies, or Literary Recreations</i>
(1796), the <i>Calamities of Authors</i> (1812-1813), and the <i>Quarrels of
Authors</i> (1814). Towards the close of his life D&rsquo;Israeli projected a
continuous history of English literature, three volumes of which
appeared in 1841 under the title of the <i>Amenities of Literature</i>.
But of all his works the most delightful is his <i>Essay on the Literary
Character</i> (1795), which, like most of his writings, abounds in
illustrative anecdotes. In the famous &ldquo;Pope controversy&rdquo; he
supported Byron and Campbell against Bowles and Hazlitt by
a defence of Pope in the form of a criticism of Joseph Spence&rsquo;s
<i>Anecdotes</i> contributed to the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (July 1820). In
1797 D&rsquo;Israeli published three novels; one of these, <i>Mejnoun and
Leila, the Arabian Petrarch and Laura</i>, was said to be the first
oriental romance in English. His last novel, <i>Despotism, or the Fall
of the Jesuits</i>, appeared in 1811, but none of his romances was
popular. He also published a slight sketch of Jewish history,
and especially of the growth of the Talmud, entitled the <i>Genius
of Judaism</i> (1833).</p>

<p>He was the author of two historical works&mdash;a brief defence of
the literary merit and personal and political character of James I.
(1816), and a learned <i>Commentary on the Life and Reign of King
Charles I.</i> (1828-1831). This was recognized by the University
of Oxford, which conferred upon the author the honorary degree
of D.C.L. As an historian D&rsquo;Israeli is distinguished by two
characteristics. In the first place, he had small interest in politics,
and no sympathy with the passionate fervour, or adequate
appreciation of the importance, of political struggles. And,
secondly, with a laborious zeal then less common than now among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
historians, he sought to bring to light fresh historical material by
patient search for letters, diaries and other manuscripts of value
which had escaped the notice of previous students. Indeed, the
honour has been claimed for him of being one of the founders of
the modern school of historical research.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of the amiable personal character and the placid life of Isaac
D&rsquo;Israeli a charming picture is to be found in the brief memoir

is, however, practically restricted to the special sense
of a member of a religious body in England which has, for one
reason or another, separated from the Established Church.
Strictly, the term includes the English Roman Catholics, who in
the original draft of the Relief Act of 1791 were styled &ldquo;Protesting
Catholic Dissenters.&rdquo; It is in practice, however, restricted
to the &ldquo;Protestant Dissenters&rdquo; referred to in sec. ii. of the
Toleration Act of 1688. The term is not applied to those bodies
who dissent from the Established Church of Scotland; and in
speaking of members of religious bodies which have seceded
from established churches abroad it is usual to employ the term
&ldquo;dissidents&rdquo; (Lat. <i>dissidere</i>, to dissent). In this connotation
the terms &ldquo;dissenter&rdquo; and &ldquo;dissenting,&rdquo; which had acquired
a somewhat contemptuous flavour, have tended since the middle
of the 19th century to be replaced by &ldquo;nonconformist,&rdquo; a term
which did not originally imply secession, but only refusal to
conform in certain particulars (<i>e.g.</i> the wearing of the surplice)
with the authorized usages of the Established Church. Still
more recently the term &ldquo;nonconformist&rdquo; has in its turn, as the
political attack on the principle of a state establishment of
religion developed, tended to give place to the style of &ldquo;Free
Churches&rdquo; and &ldquo;Free Churchman.&rdquo; All three terms are now

<p><span class="bold">DISSOLUTION<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>dissolvere</i>, to break up into parts),
the act of dissolving or reducing to constituent parts, especially
of the bringing to an end an association such as a partnership
or building society, and particularly of the termination of an
assembly. A dissolution of parliament in England is thus the end
of its existence, brought about by the efflux of time in accordance
with the Septennial Act 1716, or by an exercise of the royal
prerogative. This is done either in person, or by commission, if
parliament is sitting; if prorogued, then by proclamation. The
word is used as a synonym for end or death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DISTAFF<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span>, in the early forms of spinning, the &ldquo;rock&rdquo; or short
stick round one end of which the flax, cotton or wool is loosely
wound, and from which it is spun off by the spindle. The word is
derived from the Old English <i>distaef</i>, the first part of which is
connected with <i>dizen</i>, in modern English seen in &ldquo;bedizen,&rdquo; to
deck out or embellish, originally &ldquo;to equip the distaff with flax,
&amp;c.,&rdquo; cf. the German dialectal word <i>Diesse</i>, flax. The last part
of the word is &ldquo;staff.&rdquo; &ldquo;Distaff&rdquo; from early times has been
used to symbolize woman&rsquo;s work (cf. the use of &ldquo;spinster&rdquo; for
an unmarried woman); thus the &ldquo;distaff&rdquo; or &ldquo;spindle&rdquo; side of
a family refers to the female branch, as opposed to the &ldquo;spear&rdquo;
or male branch. The 7th of January, the day after Epiphany,
was formerly known as St Distaff&rsquo;s day, as women then began

<p><span class="bold">DISTILLATION<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (from the Lat. <i>distillare</i>, more correctly
<i>destillare</i>, to drop or trickle down), an operation consisting in the
conversion of a substance or mixture of substances into vapours
which are afterwards condensed to the liquid form; it has for its
object the separation or purification of substances by taking
advantage of differences in volatility. The apparatus consists of
three parts:&mdash;the &ldquo;retort&rdquo; or &ldquo;still,&rdquo; in which the substance is
heated; the &ldquo;condenser,&rdquo; in which the vapours are condensed;
and the &ldquo;receiver,&rdquo; in which the condensed vapours are collected.
Generally the components of a mixture will be vaporized in the
order of their boiling-points; consequently if the condensates or
&ldquo;fractions&rdquo; corresponding to definite ranges of temperature
be separately collected, it is obvious that a more or less partial
separation of the components will be effected. If the substance
operated upon be practically pure to start with, or the product
of distillation be nearly of constant composition, the operation is
termed &ldquo;purification by distillation&rdquo; or &ldquo;rectification&rdquo;; the latter
term is particularly used in the spirit industry. If a complex
mixture be operated upon, and a separation effected by collecting
the distillates in several portions, the operation is termed
&ldquo;fractional distillation.&rdquo; Since many substances decompose
either at, or below, their boiling-points under ordinary atmospheric
pressure, it is necessary to lower the boiling-point by reducing
the pressure if it be desired to distil them. This variation is
termed &ldquo;distillation under reduced pressure or in a vacuum.&rdquo;
The vaporization of a substance below its normal boiling-point
can also be effected by blowing in steam or some other vapour;
this operation is termed &ldquo;distillation with steam.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dry distillation&rdquo;
is the term used when solid substances which do not liquefy
on heating are operated upon; &ldquo;sublimation&rdquo; is the term used
when a solid distils without the intervention of a liquid phase.</p>

<p>Distillation appears to have been practised at very remote
times. The Alexandrians prepared oil of turpentine by distilling
pine-resin; Zosimus of Panopolis, a voluminous writer of the 5th
century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, speaks of the distillation of a &ldquo;divine water&rdquo; or
&ldquo;panacea&rdquo; (probably from the complex mixture of calcium
polysulphides, thiosulphate, &amp;c., and free sulphur, which is
obtained by boiling sulphur with lime and water) and advises
&ldquo;the efficient luting of the apparatus, for otherwise the valuable
properties would be lost.&rdquo; The Arabians greatly improved the
earlier apparatus, naming one form the alembic (<i>q.v.</i>); they
discovered many ethereal oils by distilling plants and plant juices,
alcohol by the distillation of wine, and also distilled water. The
alchemists gave great attention to the method, as is shown by
the many discoveries made. Nitric, hydrochloric and sulphuric
acids, all more or less impure, were better studied; and many
ethereal oils were discovered. Prior to about the 18th century
three forms of distillation were practised: (1) <i>destillatio per
ascensum</i>, in which the retort was heated from the bottom, and
the vapours escaped from the top; (2) <i>destillatio per latus</i>, in
which the vapours escaped from the side; (3) <i>destillatio per
descensum</i>, in which the retort was heated at the top, and the
vapours led off by a pipe passing through the bottom. According
to K. B. Hoffmann the earliest mention of destillatio per descensum
occurs in the writings of Aetius, a Greek physician who flourished
at about the end of the 5th century.</p>

<p>In modern times the laboratory practice of distillation was
greatly facilitated by the introduction of the condenser named
after Justus von Liebig; A. Kolbe and E. Frankland introduced
the &ldquo;reflux condenser,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> a condenser so placed that the
condensed vapours return to the distilling flask, a device permitting
the continued boiling of a substance with little loss; W.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>
Dittmar and R. AnschÃ¼tz, independently of one another, introduced
&ldquo;distillation under reduced pressure&rdquo;; and &ldquo;fractional
distillation&rdquo; was greatly aided by the columns of Wurtz (1855),
E. Linnemann (1871), and of J. A. Le Bel and A. Henninger
(1874). In chemical technology enormous strides have been
made, as is apparent from the coal-gas, coal-tar, mineral oil,
spirits and mineral acids industries.</p>

<p>The subject is here treated under the following subdivisions:
(1) ordinary distillation, (2) distillation under reduced pressure,
(3) fractional distillation, (4) distillation with steam, (5) theory
of distillation, (6) dry distillation, (7) distillation in chemical
technology and (8) commercial distillation of water.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. <i>Ordinary Distillation.</i>&mdash;The apparatus generally used is shown
in fig. 1. The substance is heated in a retort a, which consists of a
large bulb drawn out at the top to form a long neck; it may also
be provided with a tubulure, or opening, which permits the charging
of the retort, and also the insertion of a thermometer b. The retort
may be replaced by a distilling flask, which is a round-bottomed
flask (generally with a lengthened neck) provided with an inclined
side tube. The neck of the retort, or side tube of the flask, is connected
to the condenser c by an ordinary or rubber cork, according
to the nature of the substance distilled; ordinary corks soaked in
paraffin wax are very effective when ordinary or rubber corks cannot
be used. Sometimes an &ldquo;adapter&rdquo; is used; this is simply a tapering
tube, the side tube being corked into the wider end, and the condenser
on to the narrower end. The thermometer is placed so that the bulb
is near the neck of the retort or the side tube of the distilling flask.
It generally happens that much of the mercury column is outside the
flask and consequently at a lower temperature than the bulb, hence
a correction of the observed temperature is necessary. If N be the
length of the unheated mercury column in degrees, t the temperature
of this column (generally determined by a small thermometer placed
with its bulb at the middle of the column), and T the temperature
recorded by the thermometer, then the corrected temperature of the
vapour is T + 0.000143 (T &minus; t) N (T. E. Thorpe, <i>Journ. Chem. Soc.</i>,
1880, p. 159).</p>

<p>The mode of heating varies with the substance to be distilled.
For highly volatile liquids, <i>e.g.</i> ether, ligroin, &amp;c., immersion of the
flask in warm water suffices; for less volatile liquids a directly
heated water or sand bath is used; for other liquids the flask is
heated through wire gauze or asbestos board, or directly by a Bunsen.
The condensing apparatus must also be conditioned by the volatility.
With difficulty volatile substances, <i>e.g.</i> nitrobenzene, air cooling of
the retort neck or of a straight tube connected with the distilling
flask will suffice; or wet blotting-paper placed on the tube and
the receiver immersed in water may be used. For less volatile liquids
the Liebig condenser is most frequently used. In its original form,
this consists of a long tube surrounded by an outer tube so arranged
that cold water circulates in the annular space between the two.
The vapours pass through the inner tube, and the cold water enters
at the end farthest from the distilling flask. For more efficient
condensation&mdash;and also for shortening the apparatus&mdash;the central
tube may be flattened, bent into a succession
of V&rsquo;s, or twisted into a spiral form, the object in
each case being to increase the condensing surface.
Of other common types of condenser, we may
notice the &ldquo;spiral&rdquo; or &ldquo;worm&rdquo; type, which consists
of a glass, copper or tin worm enclosed in
a vessel in which water circulates; and the ball
condenser, which consists of two concentric
spheres, the vapour passing through the inner
sphere and water circulating in the space between
this and the outer (in another form the vapour
circulates in a shell, on the outside and inside of
which water circulates). A very effective type is
shown in fig. 2. The condensing water enters at
the top and is conducted to the bottom of the
inner tube, which it fills and then flows over the
outside of the outer tube; it collects in the
bottom funnel and is then led off. The vapours
pass between the inner and outer tubes.</p>

<p>Practically any vessel may serve as a receiver&mdash;test tube, flask,
beaker, &amp;c. If noxious vapours come over, it is necessary to have an
air-tight connexion between the condenser and receiver, and to provide
the latter with an outlet tube leading to an absorption column
or other contrivance in which the vapours are taken up. If the
substances operated upon decompose when heated in air, as, for
example, the zinc alkyls which inflame, the air within the apparatus
is replaced by some inert gas, <i>e.g.</i> nitrogen, carbon dioxide, &amp;c.,
which is led in at the distilling flask before the process is started, and
a slow current maintained during the operation.</p>

<p>2. <i>Distillation under Reduced Pressure.</i>&mdash;This method is adopted
for substances which decompose at their boiling-points under
ordinary pressure, and, generally, when it is desirable to work at a
lower temperature. The apparatus differs very slightly from that
employed in ordinary distillation. The &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; must be connected
on the one side to the condenser, and on the other to the
exhaust pump. A safety vessel and a manometer are generally
interposed between the pump and receiver. For the purpose of
collecting the distillates in fractions, many forms of receivers have
been devised. BrÃ¼hl&rsquo;s is one of the simplest. It consists of a
number of tubes mounted vertically on a horizontal circular disk
which rotates about a vertical axis in a cylindrical vessel. This
vessel has two tubulures: through one the end of the condenser
projects so as to be over one of the receiving tubes; the other leads
to the pump. By rotating the disk the tubes may be successively
brought under the end of the condenser. Boiling under reduced
pressure has one very serious drawback, viz. the liquid boils irregularly
or &ldquo;bumps.&rdquo; W. Dittmar showed that this may be avoided
by leading a fine, steady stream of dry gas-air, carbon dioxide,
hydrogen, &amp;c., according to the substance operated upon&mdash;through
the liquid by means of a fine capillary tube, the lower end of which
reaches to nearly the bottom of the flask. &ldquo;Bumping&rdquo; is common
in open boiling when the liquid is free from air bubbles and the
interior of the vessel is very smooth. It may be diminished by
introducing clippings of platinum foil, pieces of porcelain, glass
beads or garnets into the liquid. &ldquo;Frothing&rdquo; is another objectionable
feature with many liquids. When cold, froth can be immediately
dissipated by adding a few drops of ether. In boiling liquids its
formation may be prevented by adding paraffin wax; the wax melts
and forms a ring on the surface of the liquid, which boils tranquilly
in the centre.</p>

<p>3. <i>Fractional Distillation.</i>&mdash;By fractional distillation is meant the
separation of a mixture having components which boil at neighbouring
temperatures. The distilling flask has an elongated neck so that
the less volatile vapours are condensed and return to the flask,
while the more volatile component passes over. The success of the
operation depends upon two factors: (1) that the heating be careful,
slow and steady, and (2) that the column attached to the flask be
efficient to sort out, as it were, the most volatile vapour. Three types
of columns are employed: (1) the elongation is simply a straight or
bulb tube; (2) the column, properly termed a &ldquo;dephlegmator,&rdquo; is
so constructed that the vapours have to traverse a column of
previously condensed vapour; (3) the column is encircled by a jacket
through which a liquid circulates at the same temperature as the
boiling-point of the most volatile component. To the first type
belongs the simple straight tube, and the Wurtz tube (see fig. 3),
which is simply a series of bulbs blown on a tube. These forms are
not of much value. Several forms of the second type are in use. In
the Linnemann column the condensed vapours temporarily collect on
platinum gauzes (a) placed at the constrictions of a bulbed tube.
In the Le Bel-Henninger form a series of bulbs are connected consecutively
by means of syphon tubes (b) and having platinum gauzes
(a) at the constrictions, so that when a certain amount of liquid
collects in any one bulb it syphons over into the next lower bulb.
The Glynsky form is simpler, having only one syphon tube; at the
constrictions it is usual to have a glass bead. The &ldquo;rod-and-disk&rdquo;
form of Sidney Young is a series of disks mounted on a central
spindle and surrounded by a slightly wider tube. The &ldquo;pear-shaped&rdquo;
form of the same author consists of a series of pear-shaped
bulbs, the narrow end of one adjoining the wider end of the next
lower one. In this class may also be placed the Hempel tube, which
is simply a straight tube filled with glass beads. Of the third type
is the Warren column consisting of a spiral kept at a constant
temperature by a liquid bath. Improved forms were devised by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
F. D. Brown. Kreusler&rsquo;s form is easily made and manipulated. A
tube closed at the bottom is traversed by an open narrower tube, and
the arrangement is fitted in the neck of the distilling flask. Water
is led in by the inner tube, and leaves by a side tube fused on the
wider tube. Many comparisons of the effectiveness of dephlegmating
columns have been made (see Sidney Young, <i>Fractional Distillation</i>,
1903). The pear-shaped form is the most effective, second in order
is the Le Bel-Henninger, which, in turn, is better than the Glynsky.
The main objection to the Hempel is the retention of liquid in the
beads, and the consequent inapplicability to the distillation of small
quantities.</p>

<p>4. <i>Distillation with Steam.</i>&mdash;In this process a current of steam,
which is generated in a separate boiler and superheated, if necessary,
by circulation through a heated copper worm, is led into the distilling
vessel, and the mixed vapours condensed as in the ordinary
processes. This method is particularly successful in the case of
substances which cannot be distilled at their ordinary boiling-points
(it will be seen in the following section that distilling with steam
implies a lowering of boiling-point), and which can be readily
separated from water. Instances of its application are found in the
separation of ortho- and para-nitrophenol, the o-compound distilling
and the p- remaining behind; in the separation of aniline from the
mixture obtained by reducing nitrobenzene; of the naphthols from
the melts produced by fusing the naphthalene monosulphonic acids
with potash; and of quinoline from the reaction between aniline,
nitrobenzene, glycerin, and sulphuric acid (the product being first
steam distilled to remove any aniline, nitrobenzene, or glycerin,
then treated with alkali, and again steam distilled when quinoline
comes over). With substances prone to discolorization, as, for
example, certain amino compounds, the operation may be conducted
in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, or the water may be saturated
with sulphuretted hydrogen. Liquids other than water may be used:
thus alcohol separates &alpha;-pipecoline and ether nitropropylene.</p>

<p>5. <i>Theory of Distillation.</i>&mdash;The general observation that under a
constant pressure a pure substance boils at a constant temperature
leads to the conclusion that the distillate which comes over while
the thermometer records only a small variation is of practically
constant composition. On this fact depends &ldquo;rectification or
purification by distillation.&rdquo; A liquid boils when its vapour pressure
equals the superincumbent pressure (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vaporization</a></span>); consequently
any process which diminishes the external pressure must
also lower the boiling-point. In this we have the theory of &ldquo;distillation
under reduced pressure.&rdquo; The theory of fractional distillation,
or the behaviour of liquid mixtures when heated to their
boiling-points, is more complex. For simplicity we confine ourselves
to mixtures of two components, in which experience shows that
three cases are to be recognized according as the components are
(1) completely immiscible, (2) partially miscible, (3) miscible in all
proportions.</p>

<p>When the components are completely immiscible, the vapour
pressure of the one is not influenced by the presence of the other.
The mixture consequently distils at the temperature at which the
sum of the partial pressures equals that of the atmosphere. Both
components come over in a constant proportion until one disappears;
it is then necessary to raise the temperature in order to distil
the residue. The composition of the distillate is determinate (by
Avogadro&rsquo;s law) if the molecular weights and vapour pressure of the
components at the temperature of distillation be known. If M<span class="su">1</span>, M<span class="su">2</span>,
and P<span class="su">1</span>, P<span class="su">2</span> be the molecular weights and vapour pressures of the
components A and B, then the ratio of A to B in the distillate is
M<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">1</span>/M<span class="su">2</span>P<span class="su">2</span>. Although, as is generally the case, one liquid (say A)
is more volatile than the other (say B), <i>i.e.</i> P<span class="su">1</span> greater than P<span class="su">2</span>, if the
molecular weight of A be much less than that of B, then it is obvious
that the ratio M<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">1</span>/M<span class="su">2</span>P<span class="su">2</span> need not be very great, and hence the
less volatile liquid B would come over in fair amount. These conditions
pertain in cases where distillation with steam is successfully
practised, the relatively high volatility of water being counterbalanced
by the relatively high molecular weight of the other
component; for example, in the case of nitrobenzene and water the
ratio is 1 to 5. In general, when the substance to be distilled has a
vapour pressure of only 10 mm. at 100Â° C., distillation with steam
can be adopted, if the product can be subsequently separated from
the water.</p>

<p>When distilling a mixture of partially miscible components a
distillate of constant composition is obtained so long as two layers
are present, <i>i.e.</i> A dissolved in B and B dissolved in A, since both
of these solutions emit vapours of the same composition (this follows
since the same vapour must be in equilibrium with both solutions,
for if it were not so a cyclic system contradicting the second law
of thermodynamics would be realizable). The composition of the
vapour, however, would not be the same as that of either layer. As
the distillation proceeded one layer would diminish more rapidly than
the other until only the latter would remain; this would then distil
as a completely miscible mixture.</p>

<p>The distillation of completely miscible mixtures is the most
common practically and the most complex theoretically. A coordination
of the results obtained on the distillation of mixtures of
this nature with the introduction of certain theoretical considerations
led to the formation of three groups distinguished by the relative
solubilities of the vapours in the liquid components.</p>

<p>(i.) If the vapour of A be readily soluble in the liquid B, and the
vapour of B readily soluble in the liquid A, there will exist a mixture
of A and B which will have a lower vapour pressure than any other
mixture. The vapour pressure composition curve will be convex
to the axis of compositions, the maximum vapour pressures corresponding
to pure A and pure B, and the minimum to some mixture
of A and B. On distilling such a mixture under constant pressure, a
mixture of the two components (of variable composition) will come
over until there remains in the distilling flask the mixture of minimum
vapour pressure. This will then distil at a constant temperature.
Thus nitric acid, boiling-point 68Â°, forms a mixture with water,
boiling point 100Â°, which boils at a constant temperature of 126Â°,
and contains 68% of acid. Hydrochloric acid forms a similar
mixture which boils at 110Â° and contains 20.2% of acid. Another
mixture of this type is formic acid and water.</p>

<p>(ii.) If the vapours be sparingly soluble in the liquids there will
exist a mixture having a greater vapour pressure than that of any
other mixture. The vapour pressure-composition curve will now be
concave to the axis of composition, the minima corresponding to the
pure components. On distilling such a mixture, a mixture of constant
composition will distil first, leaving in the distilling flask one or
other of the components according to the composition of the
mixture. An example is propyl alcohol and water. At one time it
was thought that these mixtures of constant boiling-point (an extended
list is given in Young&rsquo;s <i>Fractional Distillation</i>) were definite
compounds. The above theory, coupled with such facts as the
variation of the composition of the constant boiling-point fraction
with the pressure under which the mixture is distilled, the proportionality
of the density of all mixtures to their composition, &amp;c.,
shows this to be erroneous.</p>

<p>(iii.) If the vapour of A be readily soluble in liquid B, and the
vapour of B sparingly soluble in liquid A, and if the vapour pressure
of A be greater than that of B, then the vapour pressures of mixtures
of A and B will continually diminish as one passes from 100% A
to 100% B. The vapour tension may approximate to a linear
function of the composition, and the curve will then be practically
a straight line. On distilling such a mixture pure A will come over
first, followed by mixtures in which the quantity of B continually
increases; consequently by a sufficient number of distillations
A and B can be completely separated.
Examples are water and methyl or ethyl
alcohol.</p>

<p>Van&rsquo;t Hoff (<i>Theoretical and Physical
Chemistry</i>, vol. i. p. 51) illustrates the
five cases on one diagram. In fig. 4 let
AB be the axis of composition, AP be the
vapour pressure of pure A, BQ the vapour
pressure of pure B. For immiscible liquids
the vapour pressure curve is the horizontal
line ab, described so that aP = QB
and bQ = AP. For partially miscible
liquids the curve is Pa<span class="su">1</span>b<span class="su">1</span>Q. The horizontal
line a<span class="su">1</span>b<span class="su">1</span> corresponds to the two
layers of liquid, and the inclined lines Pa<span class="su">1</span>Qb<span class="su">1</span> to solutions of B in A
and of A in B. The curves Pa<span class="su">4</span>Q, having a minimum at a<span class="su">4</span>, Pa<span class="su">3</span>Q,
having a maximum at a<span class="su">3</span>, and Pa<span class="su">5</span>Q, with neither a maximum nor
minimum, correspond to the types i., ii., iii. of completely miscible
mixtures.</p>

<p>6. <i>Dry Distillation.</i>&mdash;In this process the substance operated upon
is invariably a solid, the vapours being condensed and collected as
in the other methods. When the substance operated upon is of
uncertain composition, as, for example, coal, wood, coal-tar, &amp;c., the
term destructive distillation is employed. A more general designation
is &ldquo;pyrogenic processes,&rdquo; which also includes such operations
as leading vapours through red-hot tubes and condensing the
products. We may also consider here cases of sublimation wherein
a solid vaporizes and the vapour condenses without the occurrence
of the liquid phase.</p>

<p>Dry distillation is extremely wasteful even when definite substances
or mixtures, such as calcium acetate which yields acetone, are
dealt with, valueless by-products being obtained and the condensate
usually requiring much purification. Prior to 1830, little was known
of the process other than that organic compounds generally yielded
tarry and solid matters, but the discoveries of Liebig and Dumas (of
acetone from acetates), of Mitscherlich (of benzene from benzoates)
and of Persoz (of methane from acetates and lime) brought the operation
into common laboratory practice. For efficiency the operation
must be conducted with small quantities; caking may be prevented
by mixing the substance with sand or powdered pumice, or, better,
with iron filings, which also renders the decomposition more regular
by increasing the conductivity of the mass. The most favourable
retort is a shallow iron pan heated in a sand bath, and provided with
a screwed-down lid bearing the delivery tube. Sidney Young has
suggested conducting the operation in a current of carbon dioxide
which sweeps out the vapours as they are evolved, and also heating
in a vapour bath, <i>e.g.</i> of sulphur.</p>

<p>One of the earliest red-hot tube syntheses of importance was
the formation of naphthalene from a mixture of alcohol and ether
vapours. Such condensations were especially studied by M. P. E.
Berthelot, and shown to be very fruitful in forming hydrocarbons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
Sometimes reagents are placed in the combustion tube, for example
lead oxide (litharge), which takes up bromine and sulphur. In its
simplest form the apparatus consists of a straight tube, made of
glass, porcelain or iron according to the temperature required and
the nature of the reacting substances, heated in an ordinary combustion
furnace, the mixture entering at one end and the vapours
being condensed at the other. Apparatus can also be constructed
in which the unchanged vapours are continually circulated through
the tube. Operating in a current of carbon dioxide facilitates the
process by preventing overheating.</p>

<p>7. <i>Distillation in Chemical Technology.</i>&mdash;In laboratory practice
use is made of a fairly constant type of apparatus, only trifling
modifications being generally necessary to adapt the apparatus for
any distillation or fractionation; in technology, on the other hand,
many questions have to be considered which generally demand the
adoption of special constructions for the economic distillation of
different substances. The modes of distillation enumerated above
all occur in manufacturing practice. Distillation in a vacuum is
practised in two forms:&mdash;if the pump draws off steam as well as
air it is termed a &ldquo;wet&rdquo; air-pump; if it only draws off air, it is a
&ldquo;dry&rdquo; air-pump. In the glycerin industry the lyes obtained by
saponifying the fats are first evaporated with &ldquo;wet vacuum&rdquo; and
finally distilled with closed and live steam and a &ldquo;dry vacuum.&rdquo;
Two forms of steam distillation may be distinguished:&mdash;in one the
still is simply heated by a steam coil wound inside or outside the
still&mdash;this is termed heating by dry steam; in the other steam is
injected into the mass within the still&mdash;this is the distillation with
live steam of laboratory practice. The details of the plant&mdash;the
material and fittings of the still, the manner of heating, the form
of the condensing plant, receivers, &amp;c.&mdash;have to be determined for
each substance to be distilled in order to work with the maximum
economy.</p>

<p>For the distillation of liquids the retort is usually a cylindrical pot
placed vertically; cast iron is generally employed, in which case
the bottom is frequently incurved and thicker than the sides in order
to take up the additional wear and tear. Sometimes linings of
enamelled iron or other material are employed, which when worn
can be replaced at a far lower cost than that of a new still. Glass
stills heated by a sand bath are sometimes employed in the final
distillation of sulphuric acid; platinum, and an alloy of platinum
and iridium with a lining of gold rolled on (a discovery due to
Heraeus), are used for the same purpose. Cast iron stills are provided
with a hemispherical head or dome, generally attached to the
body of the still by bolts, and of sufficient size to allow for any
frothing. It is invariably provided with an opening to carry off the
vapours produced. In its more complete form a still has in addition
the following fittings:&mdash;The dome is provided with openings to
admit (1) the axis of the stirring gear (in some stills the stirring gear
rotates on a horizontal axis which traverses the side and not the head
of the still), (2) the inlet and outlet tubes of a closed steam coil,
(3) a tube reaching to nearly the bottom of the still to carry live
steam, (4) a tube to carry a thermometer, (5) one or more manholes
for charging purposes, (6) sight-holes through which the operation
can be watched, and (7) a safety valve. The body of the still is
provided with one or more openings at different heights to serve for
the discharge of the residue in the still, and sometimes with a glass
gauge to record the quantity of matter in the still. For dry distillations
the retorts are generally horizontal cylinders, the bottom
or lower surface being sometimes flattened. Iron and fireclay are
the materials commonly employed; wrought iron is used in the
manufacture of wood-spirit, fireclay for coal-gas (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gas</a></span>: <i>Manufacture</i>),
phosphorus, zinc, &amp;c. The vertical type, however, is
employed in the manufacture of acetone and of iodine.</p>

<p>Several modes of heating are adopted. In some cases, especially
in dry distillations, the furnace flames play directly on the retorts,
in others, such as in the case of nitric acid, the whole still comes under
the action of the furnace gases to prevent condensation on the upper
part of the still, while in others the furnace gases do not play directly
on the base or upper portion of the still but are conducted around it
by a system of flues (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coal-Tar</a></span>). Steam heating, dry or live,
is employed alone and also as an auxiliary to direct firing.</p>

<p>The condensing plant varies with the volatility of the distillate.
Air cooling is adopted whenever possible. For example, in the less
modern methods for manufacturing nitric acid the vapours were
conducted directly into double-necked bottles (<i>bombonnes</i>) immersed
in water. A more efficient arrangement consists of a stack of
vertical pipes standing up from a main or collecting trough and
connected at the top in consecutive pairs by a cross tube. By
an arrangement of diaphragms in the lower trough the vapours
are circulated through the system. As an auxiliary to air cooling the
stack may be cooled by a slow stream of water trickling down the
outside of the pipes, or, in certain cases, cold water may be injected
into the condenser in the form of a spray, where it meets the ascending
vapours. Horizontal air-cooling arrangements are also employed.
A common type of condenser consists of a copper worm placed in a
water bath; but more generally straight tubes of copper or cast iron
which cross and recross a rectangular tank are employed, since this
form is more readily repaired and cleansed. Wood-spirit, petroleum
and coal-tar distillates are condensed in plant of the latter type.
In cases where the condenser is likely to become plugged there is a
pipe by means of which live steam can be injected into the condenser.
The supply of water to the condenser is regulated according to the
volatility of the condensate. When the vapours readily condense
to a solid form the condensing plant may take the form of large
chambers; such conditions prevail in the manufacture of arsenic,
sulphur and lampblack: in the latter case (which, however, is not
properly one of distillation) the chamber is hung with sheets on
which the pigment collects. Large chambers are also used in the
condensation of mercury.</p>

<p>Dephlegmation of the vapours arising from such mixtures as coal-tar
fractions, petroleum and the &ldquo;wash&rdquo; of the spirit industry, is
very important, and many types of apparatus are employed in order
to effect a separation of the vapours. The earliest form, invented by
C. B. Mansfield to facilitate the fractionation of paraffin and coal-tar
distillates, consisted in having a pipe leading from the inclined
delivery tube of the still to the still again, so that any vapour which
condensed in the delivery tube was returned to the still. Of really
effective columns Coupier&rsquo;s was one of the earliest. The vapours
rising from the still traverse a tall vertical column, and are then
conveyed through a series of bulbs placed in a bath kept at the
boiling-point of the most volatile constituent. The more volatile
vapours pass over to the condensing plant, while the less volatile ones
condense in the bulbs and are returned to the column at varying
heights by means of connecting tubes. The French column is similar
in action. The Coffey still is one of the most effective and is
employed in the spirit, ammonia, coal-tar and other industries. It
consists of a vertical column divided into a number of sections by
horizontal plates, which are perforated so that the ascending vapours
have to traverse a layer of liquid. Above this &ldquo;separator&rdquo; is a
reflux condenser, termed the &ldquo;cooler,&rdquo; maintained at the correct
temperature so that only the more volatile component passes to
the receiver. The success of the operation chiefly depends upon the
proper management of the cooler.</p>

<p>8. <i>Commercial Distillation of Water.</i>&mdash;Distilled water, <i>i.e.</i> water
free from salts and to some extent of the dissolved gases which are
always present in natural waters, is of indispensable value in many
operations both of scientific and industrial chemistry. The apparatus
and process for distilling ordinary water are very simple.
The body of the still is made of copper, with a head and worm, or
condensing apparatus, either of copper or tin. The still is usually
fed continuously by the heated water from the condenser. The
first portion of the distillate brings over the gases dissolved in the
water, ammonia and other volatile impurities, and is consequently
rejected; scarcely two-fifths of the entire quantity of water can be
safely used as pure distilled water.</p>

<p>Apparatus for the economic production of a potable water from
sea-water is of vital importance in the equipment of ships. The
simple distillation of sea-water, and the production thereby of a
certain proportion of chemically fresh water, is a very simple
problem; but it is found that water which is merely evaporated
and recondensed has a very disagreeable flat taste, and it is only after
long exposure to pure atmospheric air, with continued agitation, or
repeated pouring from one vessel to another, that it becomes
sufficiently aerated to lose its unpleasant taste and smell and
become drinkable. The water, moreover, till it is saturated with
gases, readily absorbs noxious vapours to which it may be exposed.
For the successful preparation of potable water from sea-water, the
following conditions are essential:&mdash;1st, aeration of the distilled
product so that it may be immediately available for drinking purposes;
2nd, economy of coal to obtain the maximum of water with
the minimum expenditure of fuel; and 3rd, simplicity of working
parts, to secure the apparatus from breaking down, and enable
unskilled attendants to work it with safety. The problem is a comparatively
old one, for we find that R. Fitzgerald patented a process
in 1683 having for its purpose the &ldquo;sweetening of sea-water.&rdquo; A
history of early attempts is given in S. Hales&rsquo;s <i>Philosophical Experiments</i>,
published in 1739. Among the earlier of the modern forms
of apparatus which came into practical adoption are the inventions
of Dr Normandy and of Chaplin of Glasgow, the apparatus of
Rocher of Nantes, and that patented by GallÃ© and Mazeline of Havre.
Normandy&rsquo;s apparatus, although economical and producing water
of good quality, is very complex in its structure, consisting of very
numerous working parts, with elaborate arrangements of pipes,
cocks and other fittings. It is consequently expensive and requires
careful attention for its working. It was extensively adopted in the
British navy, the Cunard line and many other important emigrant
and mercantile lines. Chaplin&rsquo;s apparatus, which was invented and
patented later, has also since 1865 been sanctioned for use on emigrant,
troop and passenger vessels. The apparatus possesses the great
merit of simplicity and compactness, in consequence of which it is
comparatively cheap and not liable to derangement. It was adopted
by many important British and continental shipping companies,
among others by the Peninsular &amp; Oriental, the Inman, the North
German Lloyd and the Hamburg American companies.</p>

<p>The modern distilling plant consists of two main parts termed
the evaporator and condenser; in addition there must be a boiler
(sometimes steam is run off the main boilers, but this practice has
several disadvantages), pumps for circulating cold water in the
condenser and for supplying salt water to the evaporator, and a
filter through which the aerated water passes. The evaporator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
consists of a cylindrical vessel having in its lower half a horizontal
copper coil connected to the steam supply. The cylindrical vessel
is filled to a certain level with salt water and the steam turned on.
The water vaporizes and is led from the dome of the evaporator
to the head of the condenser. The water level is maintained in the
evaporator until it contains a certain amount of salt. It is then run
off, and replaced by fresh sea-water. The condenser consists of a
vertical cylinder having manifolds at the head and foot and through
which a number of tubes pass. In some types, <i>e.g.</i> the Weir, the
condensing water circulates upwards through the tubes; in others,
<i>e.g.</i> the Quiggins, the water circulates around the tubes. Various
forms of the tubes have been adopted. In the Pape-Henneberg
condenser, which has been adopted in the German navy, they are
oval in section and tend to become circular under the pressure of
the steam; this alteration in shape makes the tubes self-scaling.
In the Quiggins condenser, which has been widely adopted, <i>e.g.</i> in
the &ldquo;Lusitania,&rdquo; the steam traverses vertical copper coils tinned
inside and outside; the coils are crescent-shaped, a form which gives
a greater condensing surface and makes the coils self-scaling. The
aeration of the water is effected by blowing air into the steam before
it is condensed; as an auxiliary, the storage tanks have a false
bottom perforated by fine holes so that if air be injected below it,
the water is efficiently aerated by the air which traverses it in fine
streams. After condensation the water is filtered through charcoal.
The filter is either a separate piece of plant, or, as in the Quiggins
form, it may be placed below the coils in the same outer vessel. In
this plant the aeration is conducted by blowing in air at the base of
the condenser. After filtration the water is pumped to the storage
tanks. Many types of distilling plant are in use in addition to those
mentioned above, for example the Rayner, Kirkaldy, Merlees,
Normand; the United States navy has adopted a form designed by
the Bureau of Engineering.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;The general practice of laboratory distillation is
discussed in all treatises on practical organic chemistry; reference
may be made to Lassar-Cohn, <i>Manual of Organic Chemistry</i> (1896),
and <i>Arbeitsmethoden fÃ¼r organisch-chemische Laboratorien</i> (1901);
Hans Meyer, <i>Analyse und Konstitutionermittlung organischer
Verbindungen</i> (1909). The theory of distillation finds a place in all
treatises on physical chemistry. Of especial importance is Sidney
Young, <i>Fractional Distillation</i> (1903). The history of distillation is
to be studied in E. Gildemeister and F. Hoffmann, <i>Die Ã¤therischen
Ã–le</i> (Berlin, 1899; Eng. tr. by E. Kremers, Milwaukee Press, 1900).

<p><span class="bold">DISTRACTION<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>distrahere</i>, to pull asunder), a drawing
away or apart; a word now used generally of a state of mind,
to mean a diversion of attention, or a violent emotion amounting
almost to madness.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DISTRESS<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (from the O. Fr. <i>destrece</i>, <i>destresse</i>, from the past
participle of the Lat. <i>distringere</i>, to pull apart, used in Late Lat.
in the sense of to punish, hence to distrain), pressure, especially
of sorrow, pain or ill-fortune. As a legal term, the action of
distraining or distraint, the right which a landlord has of seizing
the personal chattels of his tenant for non-payment of rent.
Cattle <i>damage feasant</i> (doing damage or trespassing upon a neighbour&rsquo;s
land) may also be <i>distrained</i>, <i>i.e.</i> may be detained until
satisfaction be rendered for injury they have done. The cattle
or other animals thus distrained are a mere pledge in the hands
of the injured person, who has only power to retain them until
the owner appear to make satisfaction for the mischief they have
done. &ldquo;Distress damage feasant&rdquo; is also applicable to inanimate
things on the land if doing damage thereto or to its produce;
things in actual use, however, are exempt. Such distress must
be made during the actual trespass, and by whoever is aggrieved
by the damage. Distress for rent was also at one time regarded as
a mere pledge or security; but the remedy, having been found to
be speedy and efficacious, was rendered more perfect by enactments
allowing the thing taken to be sold. Blackstone notes that
the law of distresses in this respect &ldquo;has been greatly altered within
a few years last past.&rdquo; The legislature, in fact, converted an
ancient right of personal redress into a powerful remedy for the
exclusive benefit of a single class of creditors, viz. landlords.
Now that the relation of landlord and tenant in England has
come to be regarded as purely a matter of contract, the language
of the law-books seems to be singularly inappropriate. The
defaulting tenant is a &ldquo;wrong-doer,&rdquo; the landlord is the &ldquo;injured
party,&rdquo;; any attempt to defeat the landlord&rsquo;s remedy by carrying
off distrainable goods is denounced as &ldquo;fraudulent and
knavish.&rdquo; The operation of the law has, as we shall point out,
been mitigated in some important respects, but it still remains
an almost unique specimen of one-sided legislation.</p>

<p>At common law distress was said to be incident to <i>rent service</i>,
and by particular reservation to rent charges; but by 4 Geo. II.
c. 28 it was extended to <i>rent seck</i>, <i>rents of assize</i> and chief rents
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rent</a></span>). It is therefore a general remedy for rent certain in
arrear. All personal chattels are distrainable with the following
exceptions:&mdash;(1) things in which there can be no property, as
animals <i>ferae naturae</i>; (2) ledgers, daybooks, title-deeds, &amp;c.;
(3) things delivered to a person following a public trade, as a horse
sent to be shod, &amp;c.; (4) things already in the custody of the law;
(5) things which cannot be restored in as good a plight as when
distrained, that is, perishable articles; (6) fixtures; (7) beasts of
the plough and instruments of husbandry while there is other
sufficient distress to be found; (8) instruments of a man&rsquo;s trade or
profession in actual use at the time the distress is made. If not in
actual use they are only privileged in case there is other sufficient
distress upon the premises. These exceptions, it will be seen,
imply that the thing distrained is to be held as a pledge merely&mdash;not
to be sold. They also imply that in general any chattels
found on the land in question are to be available for the benefit of
the landlord, whether they belong to the tenant or not. This
principle worked with peculiar harshness in the case of lodgers,
whose goods might be seized and sold for the payment of the rent
due by their landlord to his superior landlord. By the Lodgers&rsquo;
Goods Protection Act 1871, however, where a lodger&rsquo;s goods have
been seized by the superior landlord the lodger may serve him
with a notice stating that the intermediate landlord has no
interest in the property seized, but that it is the property or in the
lawful possession of the lodger, and setting forth the amount of
the rent due by the lodger to his immediate landlord. On payment
or tender of such rent the landlord cannot proceed with the
distress against the goods in question. By the Law of Distress
Amendment Act 1908 this protection was extended to under
tenants liable to pay rent by equal quarterly instalments, as well
as to any person whatsoever who is not a tenant of the premises or
any part thereof nor has any beneficial interest therein. The act,
however, excludes certain goods, particularly goods belonging to
the husband or wife of the tenant whose rent is in arrear, goods
comprised in any bill of sale, hire purchase agreement or settlement
made by the tenant, goods in the possession or disposition
of a tenant by the consent and permission of the true owner under
such circumstances as to make the tenant reputed owner, goods
of the partner of an immediate tenant, and goods (not being goods
of a lodger) upon premises where any trade or business is carried
on in which both the immediate tenant and the under tenant
have an interest. The act does not apply where an under tenancy
has been created in breach of a covenant or agreement between
the landlord and his immediate tenant. The Law of Distress
Amendment Act 1888 also absolutely exempted from distress the
tools and implements of trade and wearing apparel and bedding
of a tenant and his family to the value of five pounds, and the
Law of Distress Amendment Act 1895 gave power to a court of
summary jurisdiction to direct that such goods, when distrained
upon, should be restored if not sold, or, if sold, to order their
value to be paid by the persons who levied the distress or directed
it to be levied. Originally the landlord could only seize things
actually on the premises, so that the remedy might be defeated by
the things being taken away. But by an act of 1710, and by the
Distress for Rent Act 1737, he may follow things fraudulently or
clandestinely removed off the premises within thirty days after
their removal, unless they have been in the meantime bona fide
sold for a valuable consideration. The sixth exception mentioned
above was held to extend to sheaves of corn; but by an act
of 1690 corn, when reaped, as well as hay, was made subject to
distress. That act was modified by the Landlord and Tenant Act
1851, under which growing crops seized by the sheriff and sold
under an execution are liable to distress for rent which becomes
due after the seizure and sale, if there is no other sufficient distress
on the premises.</p>

<p>Excessive or disproportionate distress exposes the distrainer
to an action, and any irregularity formerly made the proceedings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
void <i>ab initio</i>, so that the remedy was attended with considerable
risk. The Distress for Rent Act 1737, before alluded to, in the
interests of landlords, protected distresses for <i>rent</i> from the
consequences of irregularity. In all cases of distress for rent, if
the owner do not within five days (by the Law of Distress Amendment
Act 1888, fifteen days, if the tenant make a request in
writing to the person levying the distress and also give security
for any additional cost that may be occasioned by such extension
of time) replevy the same with sufficient security, the thing distrained
may be sold towards satisfaction of the rent and charges,
and the surplus, if any, must be returned to the owner. To
&ldquo;replevy&rdquo; is when the person distrained upon applies to the
proper authority (the registrar of the county court) to have
the thing returned to his own possession, on giving security to
try the right of taking it in an action of replevin.</p>

<p>Duties and penalties imposed by act of parliament (<i>e.g.</i> payment
of rates and taxes) are sometimes enforced by distress.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DISTRIBUTION<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (Lat, <i>distribuere</i>, to deal out), a term used in
various connexions with the general meaning of spreading out.
In law, the word is used for the division of the personal estate
of an intestate among the next-of-kin (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Intestacy</a></span>). The
important scientific question as to the distribution of plants and
animals on the earth is treated under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plants</a></span>: <i>Distribution</i>, and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Zoological Distribution</a></span>. In economics the word is used
generally for the transference of commodities from person to
person or from place to place, or the dividing up of large quantities
of commodities into smaller quantities; and in a more technical
sense, for the division of the product of industry amongst the
various members or classes of the community. The theory of
economic distribution, <i>i.e.</i> the causes which determine rent, wages,
profits and interest, forms an important subject-matter in all
text-books. Among recent works, see E. Cannan&rsquo;s <i>History of
Theories of Production and Distribution, 1776-1848</i> (1893), J. R.
Common&rsquo;s <i>Distribution of Wealth</i> (1893), and H. J. Davenport&rsquo;s
<i>Value and Distribution</i> (Chicago, 1908).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DISTRICT,<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> a word denoting in its more general sense, a tract
or extent of a country, town, &amp;c., marked off for administrative
or other purposes, or having some special and distinguishing
characteristics. The medieval Latin <i>districtus</i> (from <i>distringere</i>,
to distrain) is defined by Du Cange as <i>Territorium feudi, seu
tractus, in quo Dominus vassallos et tenentes suos distringere potest</i>;
and as <i>justitiae exercendae in eo tractu facultas</i>. It was also used
of the territory over which the feudal lord exercised his jurisdiction
generally. It may be noted that <i>distringere</i> had a wider
significance than &ldquo;to distrain&rdquo; in the English legal sense (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Distress</a></span>). It is defined by Du Cange as <i>compellere ad aliquid
faciendum per mulctam, poenam, vel capto pignore</i>. In English
usage, apart from its general application in such forms as postal
district, registration district and the like, &ldquo;district&rdquo; has specific
usages for ecclesiastical and local government purposes. It is thus
applied to a division of a parish under the Church Building Acts,
originally called a &ldquo;perpetual curacy,&rdquo; and the church serving
such a division is properly a &ldquo;district chapel.&rdquo; Under the Local
Government Act of 1894 counties are divided for the purposes of
the act into urban and rural districts. In British India the word
is used to represent the <i>zillah</i>, an administrative subdivision of
a province or presidency. In the United States of America the
word has many administrative, judicial and other applications.
In South Carolina it was used instead of &ldquo;county&rdquo; for the chief
division of the state other than in the coast region. In the
Virginias, Tennessee, Georgia, Kentucky and Maryland it answers
to &ldquo;township&rdquo; or precinct, elsewhere the principal subdivision of
a county. It is used for an electoral &ldquo;division,&rdquo; each state being
divided into Congressional and senatorial districts; and also
for a political subdivision ranking between an unorganized and an
organized Territory&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the District of Columbia and Alaska.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DITHMARSCHEN,<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Ditmarsh</span> (in the oldest form of the
name <i>Thiatmaresgaho</i>, Dietmar&rsquo;s Gau), a territory between the
Eider, the Elbe and the North Sea, forming the western part of
the old duchy of Holstein, and now included in the Prussian
province of Schleswig-Holstein. It contains about 550 sq. m.
with 90,000 inhabitants. The territory consists to the extent of
one half of good pasture land, which is preserved from inroads of
the sea by banks and dams, the other half being mostly waste.
It was originally colonized mainly from Friesland and Saxony.
The district was subjugated and Christianized by Charlemagne
in 804, and ranked as a separate <i>Gau</i>, included perhaps in the
countship of Stade, or <i>Comitalus utriusque ripae</i>. From the same
century, according to one opinion, or from the year 1182, when
the countship was incorporated with their see, according to
another, the archbishops of Bremen claimed supremacy over the
land; but the inhabitants, who had developed and consolidated
a systematic organism for self-government, made obstinate
resistance, and rather attached themselves to the bishop of
Schleswig. Ditmarsken, to use the Scandinavian form of the
name, continued part of the Danish dominions till the disastrous
battle of BornhÃ¶ved in 1227, when its former independence was
regained. The claims of the archbishop of Bremen were now so
far recognized that he exercised the royal rights of <i>Heerbann</i> and
<i>Blutbann</i>,<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> enjoyed the consequent emoluments, and was represented
first by a single <i>advocatus</i>, or <i>Vogt</i>, and afterwards by one
for each of the five DÃ¶ffts, or marks, into which the land was
divided after the establishment of Meldorf. The community was
governed by a <i>Landrath</i> of forty-eight elective consuls, or twelve
from each of the four marks; and even in the 14th century the
power of the episcopal <i>advocati</i> was so slight that a chronicler
quoted by Conrad von Maurer says, <i>De Ditmarschen leven sunder
Heren und Hovedt unde dohn wadt se willen</i>, &ldquo;the Ditmarschen
live without lord and head, and do what they will.&rdquo; In 1319 and
in 1404 they succeeded in defeating the invasions of the Holstein
nobles; and though in 1474 the land was nominally incorporated
with the duchy by the emperor Frederick III., the attempt of the
Danish king Hans and the duke of Gottorp to enforce the decree
in 1500 resulted only in their complete rout in the marshes of the
Dussend-DÃ¼wels-Warf. During the early part of the century
which began with such prestige for Ditmarsh, it was the scene of
violent internal conflict in regard to the religious questions of
the time; and, thus weakened, it was obliged in 1559 to submit
to partition among its three conquerors&mdash;King Frederick II. of
Denmark and Dukes John and Adolphus. A new division took
place on Duke John&rsquo;s death in 1581, by which Frederick obtained
South Ditmarsh, with its chief town of Meldorf, and Adolphus
obtained North Ditmarsh, with its chief town of Heide; and this
arrangement continued till 1773, when all the Gottorp possessions
were incorporated with the Danish crown.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DITHYRAMBIC POETRY,<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> the description of poetry in which
the character of the dithyramb is preserved. It remains quite
uncertain what the derivation or even the primitive meaning
of the Greek word <span class="grk" title="dithyrambos">&#948;&#953;&#952;&#973;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span> is, although many conjectures
have been attempted. It was, however, connected from earliest
times with the choral worship of Dionysus. A dithyramb is
defined by Grote as a round choric dance and song in honour
of the wine-god. The earliest dithyrambic poetry was probably
improvised by priests of Bacchus at solemn feasts, and expressed,
in disordered numbers, the excitement and frenzy felt by the
worshippers. This element of unrestrained and intoxicated
vehemence is prominent in all poetry of this class. The dithyramb
was traditionally first practised in Naxos; it spread to
other islands, to Boeotia and finally to Athens. Arion is said to
have introduced it at Corinth, and to have allied it to the worship
of Pan. It was thus &ldquo;merged,&rdquo; as Professor G. G. Murray says,
&ldquo;into the Satyr-choir of wild mountain-goats&rdquo; out of which sprang
the earliest form of tragedy. But when tragic drama had so far
developed as to be quite independent, the dithyramb did not, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
that account, disappear. It flourished in Athens until after the
age of Aristotle. So far as we can distinguish the form of the
ancient Greek dithyramb, it must have been a kind of irregular
wild poetry, not divided into strophes or constructed with any
evolution of the theme, but imitative of the enthusiasm created
by the use of wine, by what passed as the Dionysiac delirium. It
was accompanied on some occasions by flutes, on others by the
lyre, but we do not know enough to conjecture the reasons of the
choice of instrument. Pindar, in whose hands the ode took such
magnificent completeness, is said to have been trained in the
elements of dithyrambic poetry by a certain Lasus of Hermione.
Ion, having carried off the prize in a dithyrambic contest,
distributed to every Athenian citizen a cup of Chian wine. In the
opinion of antiquity, pure dithyrambic poetry reached its climax
in a lost poem. <i>The Cyclops</i>, by Philoxenus of Cythera, a poet of
the 4th century <span class="sc">b.c.</span> After this time, the composition of dithyrambs,
although not abandoned, rapidly declined in merit. It
was essentially a Greek form, and was little cultivated, and always
without success, by the Latins. The dithyramb had a spectacular
character, combining verse with music. In modern literature,
although the adjective &ldquo;dithyrambic&rdquo; is often used to describe
an enthusiastic movement in lyric language, and particularly in
the ode, pure dithyrambs have been extremely rare. There are,
however, some very notable examples. The <i>Baccho in Toscana</i>
of Francesco Redi (1626-1698), which was translated from the
Italian, with admirable skill, by Leigh Hunt, is a piece of genuine
dithyrambic poetry. <i>Alexander&rsquo;s Feast</i> (1698), by Dryden, is
the best example in English. But perhaps more remarkable,
and more genuinely dithyrambic than either, are the astonishing
improvisations of Karl Mikael Bellman (1740-1795),
whose Bacchic songs were collected in 1791 and form one of
the most remarkable bodies of lyrical poetry in the literature
of Sweden.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DITTERSDORF, KARL DITTERS VON<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (1739-1799), Austrian
composer and violinist, was born in Vienna on the 2nd of
November 1739, his father&rsquo;s name being Ditters. Having shown
as a child marked talent for the violin, he was allowed to play in
the orchestras of St Stephen&rsquo;s and the <i>Schottenkirche</i>, where he
attracted the attention of a notable patron of music, Prince
Joseph Frederick of Hildburghausen (1702-1787), who is also
remembered as a soldier for his disastrous leading of the forces of
the Empire at Rossbach. The prince gave the boy, now eleven
years old, a place in his private orchestra&mdash;the first of the kind
established in Vienna,&mdash;and also saw to it that he received
an excellent general education. The Seven Years&rsquo; War proved
disastrous to both music and morals; and young Ditters, who
had fallen into evil ways, fled from Hildburghausen, whither he
had gone with the prince, to avoid the payment of his gambling
debts. His patron generously forgave and recalled him, but
soon afterwards gave up his orchestra at Vienna. Ditters now
obtained a place in the Vienna opera; but he was not satisfied,
and in 1761 eagerly accepted an invitation to accompany Gluck,
whose acquaintance, as well as that of Haydn, he had made while
in the service of the prince, on a professional journey to Italy.
His success as a violinist on this occasion was equal to that
of Gluck as composer; and on his return to Vienna he was
recognized as the superior of Antonio Lolli, who as virtuoso
had hitherto held the palm. In 1764 he was again associated
with Gluck in the musical part of the ceremonies at Frankfort,
attending the coronation of the archduke Joseph as King of the
Romans. His next appointment was that of conductor of the
orchestra of the bishop of Grosswardein, a Hungarian magnate,
at Pressburg. He set up a private stage in the episcopal palace,
and wrote for it his first &ldquo;opera buffa,&rdquo; <i>Amore in musica</i>. His
first oratorio, <i>Isacco figura del Redentore</i>, was also written during
this time; but the scandal of performances of light opera by the
bishop&rsquo;s company, even on fast days and during Advent, outweighed
this pious effort; the empress Maria Theresa sharply
called the worldly prelate to order; and he, in a huff, dismissed
his orchestra (1769). After a short interlude, Ditters was again
in the service of an ecclesiastical patron, count von Schafgotsch,
prince bishop of Breslau, at his estate of Johannesberg in Silesia.
Here he displayed so much skill as a sportsman, that the bishop
procured for him the office of forester (<i>Forstmeister</i>) of the
principality of Neisse. He had already, by the same influence,
been made knight of the Golden Spur (1770). At Johannesberg
Ditters also produced a comic opera, <i>Il Viaggiatore americano</i>,
and an oratorio, <i>Davide</i>. The title rÃ´le of the latter was taken
by a pretty Italian singer, Signora Nicolini, whom Ditters
married. In 1773 he was ennobled as Karl von Dittersdorf, and
at the same time was appointed administrator (<i>Amtshauptmann</i>)
of Freyenwaldau, an office which he performed by deputy. In
the same year his oratorio <i>Ester</i> was produced in Vienna. During
the War of Bavarian Succession the prince bishop&rsquo;s orchestra
was dissolved, and Dittersdorf employed himself in his office at
Freyenwaldau; but after the peace of Tetschen (1779) he again
became conductor of the reconstituted orchestra. From this
time forward his output was enormous. In 1780 ten months
sufficed for the production of his <i>Giobbe</i> (Job) and four operas,
three of which were successful; and besides these he wrote a
large number of &ldquo;characterized symphonies,&rdquo; founded on the
<i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid. He was now at the height of his fame,
and spent the fortune which it brought him in much luxury. But
after a time his patron fell on evil days, the famous orchestra had
to be reduced, and when the bishop died in 1795 his successor
dismissed the composer with a small money gift. Poor and
broken in health, he accepted the asylum offered to him by Ignaz
Freiherr von Stillfried, on his estate near Neuhaus in Bohemia,
where he spent what strength was left him in a feverish effort
to make money by the composition of operas, symphonies and
pianoforte pieces. He died on the 1st of October 1799, praying
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s reward&rdquo; for whoever should save his family from
starvation. On his death-bed he dictated to his son his
<i>Lebensbeschreibung</i> (autobiography).</p>

<p>Dittersdorf&rsquo;s chief talent was for comic opera and instrumental
music in the sonata forms. In both of these branches his work
still shows signs of life, and it is of great historical interest, since
he was not only an excellent musician and a friend of Haydn but
also a thoroughly popular writer, with a lively enough musical wit
and sense of effect to embody in an amusing and fairly artistic
form exactly what the best popular intelligence of the times saw
in the new artistic developments of Haydn. Thus, while in the
amiable monotony and diffuseness of Boccherini we may trace
Haydn as a force tending to disintegrate the polyphonic suite-forms
of instrumental music, in Dittersdorf on the other hand
we see the popular conception of the modern sonata and dramatic
style. Yet, with all his popularity, the reality of his progressive
outlook may be gauged from the fact that, though he was at
least as famous a violinist as Boccherini was a violoncellist, there
is in his string quartets no trace of that tendency to sacrifice the
ensemble to an exhibition of his own playing which in Boccherini&rsquo;s
chamber music puts the violoncello into the same position as the
first violin in the chamber music of Spohr. In Dittersdorf&rsquo;s
quartets (at least six of which are worthy of their survival at the
present day) the first violin leads indeed, but not more than is
inevitable in such unsophisticated music where the normal place
for melody is at the top. The appearance of greater vitality
in the texture of Boccherini&rsquo;s quintets is produced merely by
the fact that, his special instrument being the violoncello, his
displays of brilliance inevitably occur in the inner parts. Six
of Dittersdorf&rsquo;s symphonies on the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid were
republished in 1899, the centenary of his death. In them we have
an amusing and sometimes charming illustration of the way in
which at transitional periods music, as at the present day, is ready
to make crutches of literature. The end of the representation of
the conversion of the Lycian peasants into frogs is prophetically
and ridiculously Wagnerian in its ingenious expansion of rhythm
and eminently expert orchestration. Every external feature of
Dittersdorf&rsquo;s style seems admirably apt for success in German
comic opera on a small scale; and an occasional experimental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
performance at the present day of his <i>Doktor und Apotheker</i> is
not less his due than the survival of his best quartets.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DITTON, HUMPHRY<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (1675-1715), English mathematician,
was born at Salisbury on the 29th of May 1675. He studied
theology, and was for some years a dissenting minister at
Tonbridge, but on the death of his father he devoted himself
to the congenial study of mathematics. Through the influence
of Sir Isaac Newton he was elected mathematical master in
Christ&rsquo;s hospital. He was author of the following memoirs and
treatises:&mdash;&ldquo;Of the Tangents of Curves, &amp;c.,&rdquo; <i>Phil. Trans.</i> vol.
xxiii.; &ldquo;A Treatise on Spherical Catoptrics,&rdquo; published in the
<i>Phil. Trans.</i> vol. xxiv., from which it was copied and reprinted
in the <i>Acta Eruditorum</i> (1707), and also in the Memoirs of the
Academy of Sciences at Paris; <i>General Laws of Nature and
Motion</i> (1705), a work which is commended by Wolfius as illustrating
and rendering easy the writings of Galileo and Huygens, and
the <i>Principia</i> of Newton; <i>An Institution of Fluxions, containing
the First Principles, Operations, and Applications of that admirable
Method, as invented by Sir Isaac Newton</i> (1706). In 1709 he
published the <i>Synopsis Algebraica</i> of John Alexander, with many
additions and corrections. In his <i>Treatise on Perspective</i> (1712)
he explained the mathematical principles of that art; and
anticipated the method afterwards elaborated by Brook Taylor.
In 1714 Ditton published his <i>Discourse on the Resurrection of
Jesus Christ;</i> and <i>The New Law of Fluids, or a Discourse concerning
the Ascent of Liquids in exact Geometrical Figures, between two
nearly contiguous Surfaces</i>. To this was annexed a tract (&ldquo;Matter
not a Cogitative Substance&rdquo;) to demonstrate the impossibility of
thinking or perception being the result of any combination of the
parts of matter and motion. There was also added an advertisement
from him and William Whiston concerning a method for
discovering the longitude, which it seems they had published
about half a year before. Although the method had been approved
by Sir Isaac Newton before being presented to the Board
of Longitude, and successfully practised in finding the longitude
between Paris and Vienna, the board determined against it.
This disappointment, aggravated as it was by certain lines
written by Dean Swift, affected Ditton&rsquo;s health to such a degree
that he died in the following year, on the 15th of October 1715.</p>

Area of district, 20 sq. m. Pop. (1900) 14,614. The anchorage
is fairly protected from the sea, but the depth of water is only 3 to
4 fathoms. The channel between the island on Diu and the mainland
is navigable only by fishing boats and small craft. The town
is well fortified on the old system, being surrounded by a wall
with towers at regular intervals. Many of the inhabitants are
the well-known Banyan merchants of the east coast of Africa and
Arabia. Native spirits are distilled from the palm, salt is made
and fish caught. The trade of the town, however, is decayed.
There are remains of several fine ancient buildings. The cathedral
or SÃ© Matriz, dating from 1601, was formerly a Jesuit college.
The mint, the arsenal and several convents (now ruined or
converted to other uses) are also noteworthy. The Portuguese,
under treaty with Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, built a fort here in
1535, but soon quarrelled with the natives and were besieged in
1538 and 1545. The second siege is one of the most famous
in Indo-Portuguese history, and is the subject of an epic by
Jeronymo Corte Real (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIURETICS<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="diÃ¡">&#948;&#953;&#940;</span>, through, and <span class="grk" title="ourein">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, pass urine),
the name given to remedies which, under certain conditions,
stimulate an increased flow of urine. Their mode of action
is various. Some are absorbed into the blood, carried to the
secretory organs (the kidneys), and stimulate them directly,
causing an increased flow of blood; others act as stimulants
through the nervous system. A second class act in congested
conditions of the kidneys by diminishing the congestion. Another
class, such as the saline diuretics, are effectual by virtue of their
osmotic action. A fourth class are diuretic by increasing the blood
pressure within the vessels in general, and the Malpighian tufts
in particular,&mdash;some, as digitalis, by increasing the strength of
the heart&rsquo;s contractions, and others, as water, by increasing the
amount of fluid circulating in the vessels. Some remedies, as
mercury, although not diuretic themselves, when prescribed along
with those which have this action, increase their effect. The
same remedy may act in more than one way, <i>e.g.</i> alcohol, besides
stimulating the secretory organs directly, is a stimulant to the
circulation, and thus increases the pressure within the vessels.
Diuretics are prescribed when the quantity of urine is much
diminished, or when, although the quantity may be normal, it is
wished to relieve some other organ or set of organs of part of their
ordinary work, or to aid in carrying off some morbid product
circulating in the blood, or to hasten the removal of inflammatory
serous exudations, or of dropsical collections of fluid. Caffeine,
which is far the best true diuretic, acts in nearly every way
mentioned above. Together with digitalis it is the most efficient
remedy for cardiac dropsy. A famous diuretic pill, known as
Guy&rsquo;s pill, consists of a grain each of mercurial pill, digitalis
leaves and squill, made up with extract of henbane. Digitalis,
producing its diuretic effect by its combined action on heart,
vessels and kidneys, is much used in the oedema of mitral disease,
but must be avoided in chronic Bright&rsquo;s disease, as it increases
the tension of the pulse, already often dangerously high.
Turpentine and cantharides are not now recommended as
diuretics, as they are too irritating to the kidneys.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIVAN<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (Arabic <i>d&#299;w&#257;n</i>), a Persian word, derived probably from
Aramaic, meaning a &ldquo;counting-house, office, bureau, tribunal&rdquo;;
thence, on one side, the &ldquo;account-books and registers&rdquo; of such
an office, and, on another, the &ldquo;room where the office or tribunal
sits&rdquo;; thence, again, from &ldquo;account-book, register,&rdquo; a &ldquo;book
containing the poems of an author,&rdquo; arranged in a definite order
(alphabetical according to the rhyme-words), perhaps because of
the saying, &ldquo;Poetry is the register (<i>d&#299;w&#257;n</i>) of the Arabs,&rdquo; and
from &ldquo;bureau, tribunal,&rdquo; &ldquo;a long seat, formed of a mattress laid
against the side of the room, upon the floor or upon a raised
structure or frame, with cushions to lean against&rdquo; (Lane, <i>Lexicon</i>,
930 f.). All these meanings existed and exist, especially &ldquo;bureau,
tribunal,&rdquo; &ldquo;book of poems&rdquo; and &ldquo;seat&rdquo;<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a>; but the order of
derivation may have been slightly different. The word first
appears under the caliphate of Omar (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 634-644). Great
wealth, gained from the Moslem conquests, was pouring into
Medina, and a system of business management and administration
became necessary. This was copied from the Persians and given
the Persian name, &ldquo;divan.&rdquo; Later, as the state became more
complicated, the term was extended over all the government
bureaus. The divan of the Sublime Porte was for long the
council of the empire, presided over by the grand vizier.</p>

speaking, from 1820 to 1850, wherever the romantic movement in
literature penetrated. All the boudoirs of that generation were
garnished with divans; they even spread to coffee-houses, which
were sometimes known as &ldquo;divans&rdquo; or &ldquo;Turkish divans&rdquo;; and

<p><span class="bold">DIVER,<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> a name that when applied to a bird is commonly used
in a sense even more vague than that of loom, several of the sea
ducks or <i>Fuligulinae</i> and mergansers being frequently so called,
to say nothing of certain of the auks or <i>Alcidae</i> and grebes; but
in English ornithological works the term diver is generally
restricted to the Family known as <i>Colymbidae</i>, a very well-marked
group of aquatic birds, possessing great, though not exceptional,
powers of submergence, and consisting of a single genus <i>Colymbus</i>
which is composed of three, or at most four, species, all confined
to the northern hemisphere. This Family belongs to the
<i>Cecomorphae</i> of T. H. Huxley, and is usually supposed to occupy
a place between the <i>Alcidae</i> and <i>Podicipedidae</i>; but to which of
these groups it is most closely related is undecided. Professor
Brandt in 1837 (<i>Beitr. Naturgesch. VÃ¶gel</i>, pp. 124-132) pointed out
the osteological differences of the grebes and the divers, urging
the affinity of the latter to the auks; while, thirty years later,
Professor Alph. Milne-Edwards (<i>Ois. foss. France</i>, i. pp. 279-283)
inclined to the opposite view, chiefly relying on the similarity of a
peculiar formation of the tibia in the grebes and divers,<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> which
indeed is very remarkable, and, in the latter group, attracted the
attention of Willughby more than 230 years ago. On the other
hand Professor Brandt, and Rudolph Wagner shortly after
(Naumann&rsquo;s <i>VÃ¶gel Deutschlands</i>, ix. p. 683, xii. p. 395), had
already shown that the structure of the knee-joint in the grebes
and divers differs in that the former have a distinct and singularly
formed <i>patella</i> (which is undeveloped in the latter) in addition to
the prolonged, pyramidally formed, procnemial process&mdash;which
last may, from its exaggeration, be regarded as a character almost
peculiar to these two groups.<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The evidence furnished by oology
and the newly-hatched young seems to favour Brandt&rsquo;s views.
The abortion of the <i>rectrices</i> in the gerbes, while these feathers
are fairly developed in the divers, is another point that helps to
separate the two Families.</p>

<p>The commonest species of <i>Colymbus</i> is <i>C. septentrionalis</i>, known
as the red-throated diver from an elongated patch of dark bay
which distinguishes the throat of the adult in summer dress.
Immature birds want the bay patch, and have the back so much
more spotted that they are commonly known as &ldquo;speckled
divers.&rdquo; Next in size is the black-throated diver, <i>C. arcticus</i>,
having a light grey head and a gular patch of purplish-black,
above which is a semicollar of white striped vertically with black.
Still bigger is the great northern diver, <i>C. glacialis</i> or <i>torquatus</i>,
with a glossy black head and neck, two semicollars of white and
black vertical stripes, and nearly the whole of the black back and
upper surface of the wings beautifully marked with white spots,
varying in size and arranged in belts.<a name="fa3i" id="fa3i" href="#ft3i"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Closely resembling this
bird, so as to be most easily distinguished from it by its yellow bill,
is <i>C. adamsi</i>. The divers live chiefly on fish, and are of eminently
marine habit, though invariably resorting for the purpose of
breeding to freshwater lakes, where they lay two dark brown
eggs on the very brink; but they are not unfrequently found far
from the sea, being either driven inland by stress of weather, or
exhausted in their migrations. Like most birds of their build,
they chiefly trust to swimming, whether submerged or on the
surface, as a means of progress, but once on the wing their flight
is strong and they can mount to a great height. In winter their
range is too extensive and varied to be here defined, though it is
believed never to pass, and in few directions to approach, the
northern tropic; but the geographical distribution of the several
forms in summer requires mention. While <i>C. septentrionalis</i>
inhabits the north temperate zone of both hemispheres, <i>C.
arcticus</i> breeds in suitable places from the Hebrides to Scandinavia,
and across the Russian empire, it would seem, to Japan,
reappearing in the north-west of North America,<a name="fa4i" id="fa4i" href="#ft4i"><span class="sp">4</span></a> though its
eastern limit on that continent cannot be definitely laid down;
but it is not found in Greenland, Iceland, Shetland or Orkney.
<i>C. glacialis</i>, on the contrary, breeds throughout the north-eastern
part of Canada, in Greenland and in Iceland. It has been
said to do so in Scotland as well as in Norway, but the assertion
seems to lack positive proof, and it may be doubted whether, with
the exception of Iceland, it is indigenous to the Old World,<a name="fa5i" id="fa5i" href="#ft5i"><span class="sp">5</span></a> since
the form observed in North-eastern Asia is evidently that which
has been called <i>C. adamsi</i>, and is also found in North-western
America; but it may be remarked that one example of this form
has been taken in England (<i>Proc. Zool. Society</i>, 1859, p. 206) and

<p><span class="bold">DIVERS<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> and <span class="bold">DIVING APPARATUS.</span> To &ldquo;dive&rdquo; (Old Eng.
<i>dÃºfan</i>, <i>d&#375;fan</i>; cf. &ldquo;dip&rdquo;) is to plunge under water, and in the
ordinary procedure of swimmers is distinguished from simple
plunging in that it involves remaining under the water for an
interval of more or less duration before coming to the surface.
In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Swimming</a></span> the sport of diving in this sense is
considered. Here we are only concerned with diving as the
function of a &ldquo;diver,&rdquo; whose business it is to go under water
(in modern times, assisted by specially devised apparatus) in
order to work.</p>

<p><i>Unassisted or Natural Diving.</i>&mdash;The earliest reference to the
practice of the art of diving for a purpose of utility occurs in the
<i>Iliad</i>, 16, 745-750, where Patroclus compares the fall of Hector&rsquo;s
charioteer to the action of a diver diving for oysters. Thus it
would seem that the art was known about 1000 years before
the Christian era. Thucydides is the first to mention the employment
of divers for mechanical work under water. He relates that
divers were employed during the siege of Syracuse to saw down
the barriers which had been constructed below the surface of the
water with the object of obstructing and damaging any Grecian
war vessels which might attempt to enter the harbour. At the
siege of Tyre, divers were ordered by Alexander the Great to
impede or destroy the submarine defences of the besieged as they
were erected. The purpose of these obstructions was analogous
to that of the submarine mine of to-day.</p>

<p>The employment of divers for the salvage of sunken property is
first mentioned by Livy, who records that in the reign of Perseus
considerable treasure was recovered from the sea. By a law of
the Rhodians, their divers were allowed a proportion of the value
recovered, varying with the risk incurred, or the depth from which
the treasure was salved. For instance, if the diver raised it from
a depth of eight cubits (12 ft.) he received one-third for himself;
if from sixteen cubits (24 ft.) one half; but upon goods lost near
the shore, and recovered from a depth of two cubits (36 in.), his
share was only one tenth.</p>

<p>These are examples of unassisted diving as practised by the
Ancients. Their primitive method, however, is still in vogue in
some parts of the world&mdash;notably in the Ceylon pearl fisheries and
in the Mediterranean sponge fisheries, and it may, therefore, be
as well to mention the system adopted by the natural, or naked,
diver of to-day.</p>

<p>The volume and power of respiration of the lungs vary in
different individuals, some persons being able to hold their breath
longer than others, so that it naturally follows that one man may
be able to stay longer under water than another. The longest
time that a natural diver has been known to remain beneath the
surface is about two minutes. Some pearl and sponge divers rub
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
their bodies with oil, and put wool, saturated with oil, in their
ears. Others hold in their mouth a piece of sponge soaked in oil,
which they renew every time they descend. It is doubtful,
however, whether these expedients are beneficial. The men who
dive in this primitive fashion take with them a flat stone with a
hole in the centre; to this is attached a rope, which is secured to
the diving boat and serves to guide them to particular spots below.
When the diver reaches the sea bottom he tears off as much sponge
within reach as possible, or picks up pearl shells, as the case may
be, and then pulls the rope to indicate to the man in the boat that
he wishes to be hauled up. But so exhausting is the work, and so
severe the strain on the system, that, after a number of dives in
deep water, the men often become insensible, and blood <span class="correction" title="amended from sometime">sometimes</span>
bursts from nose, ears and mouth.</p>

<p><i>Early Diving Appliances.</i>&mdash;The earliest mention of any
appliance for assisting divers is by Aristotle, who says that divers
are sometimes provided with instruments for respiration through
which they can draw air from above the water and which thus
enable them to remain a long time under the sea (<i>De Part. Anim.</i>
2, 16), and also that divers breathe by letting down a metallic
vessel which does not get filled with water but retains the air
within it (<i>Problem.</i> 32, 5). It is also recorded that Alexander the
Great made a descent into the sea in a machine called a <i>colimpha</i>,
which had the power of keeping a man dry, and at the same time
of admitting light. Pliny also speaks of divers engaged in the
strategy of ancient warfare, who drew air through a tube, one end
of which they carried in their mouths, whilst the other end was
made to float on the surface of the water. Roger Bacon in
1240, too, is supposed to have invented a contrivance for enabling
men to work under water; and in Vegetius&rsquo;s <i>De Re Militari</i>
(editions of 1511 and 1532, the latter in the British Museum) is
an engraving representing a diver wearing a tight-fitting helmet
to which is attached a long leathern pipe leading to the surface,
where its open end is kept afloat by means of a bladder. This
method of obtaining air during subaqueous operations was
probably suggested by the action of the elephant when swimming;
the animal instinctively elevates its trunk so that the
end is above the surface of the water, and thus is enabled to
take in fresh air at every inspiration.</p>

<p>A certain Repton invented &ldquo;water armour&rdquo; in the year 1617,
but when tried it was found to be useless. G. A. Borelli in the
year 1679 invented an apparatus which enabled persons to go to a
certain depth under water, and he is credited with being the first
to introduce means of forcing air down to the diver. For this
purpose he used a large pair of bellows. John Lethbridge, a
Devonshire man, in the year 1715 contrived &ldquo;a watertight leather
case for enclosing the person.&rdquo; This leather case held about half
a hogshead of air, and was so adapted as to give free play to
arms and legs, so that the wearer could walk on the sea bottom,
examine a sunken vessel and salve her cargo, returning to the
surface when his supply of air was getting exhausted. It is said
that Lethbridge made a considerable fortune by his invention.
The next contrivance worthy of mention, and most nearly
resembling the modern diving-dress, was an apparatus invented
by Kleingert, of Breslau, in 1798. This consisted of an egg-ended
metallic cylinder enveloping the head and the body to the hips.
The diver was encased first of all in a leather jacket having tight-fitting
arms, and in leather drawers with tight-fitting legs. To
these the cylinder was fastened in such a way as to render the
whole equipment airtight. The air supply was drawn through a
pipe which was connected with the mouth of the diver by an ivory
mouthpiece, the surface end being held above water after the
manner mentioned in Vegetius, viz. by means of a floating bladder
attached to it. The foul air escaped through another pipe held in
a similar manner above the surface of the water, inhalation being
performed by the mouth and exhalation by the nose, the act of
inhalation causing the chest to expand and so to expel the vitiated
air through the escape pipe. The diver was weighted when going
under water, and when he wished to ascend he released one of
his weights, and attached it to a rope which he held, and it
was afterwards hauled up.</p>

<p><i>Modern Apparatus.</i>&mdash;This, or equally cumbersome apparatus,
was the only diving gear in use up till 1819, in which year
Augustus Siebe (the founder of the firm of Siebe, Gorman &amp; Co.),
invented his &ldquo;open&rdquo; dress, worked in conjunction with an air
force pump. This dress consisted of a metal helmet and shoulder-plate
attached to a watertight jacket, under which, fitting more
closely to the body, were worn trousers, or rather a combination
suit reaching to the armpits. The helmet was fitted with an air
inlet valve, to which one end of a flexible tube was attached, the
other end being connected at the surface with a pump which
supplied the diver with a constant stream of fresh air. The air,
which kept the water well down, forced its way between the jacket
and the under-garment, and escaped to the surface on exactly the
same principle as that of the diving bell; hence the term &ldquo;open&rdquo;
as applied to this dress.</p>

<p>Although most excellent work was accomplished with this dress&mdash;work
which could not be attempted before its introduction&mdash;it
was still far from perfect. It was absolutely necessary for the
diver to maintain an upright, or but very slightly stooping,
position whilst under water; if he stumbled and fell, the water
filled his dress, and, unless quickly brought to the surface, he was
in danger of being drowned. To overcome this and other defects,
Siebe carried out a large number of experiments extending over
several years, which culminated, in the year 1830, in the introduction
of his &ldquo;close&rdquo; dress in combination with a helmet fitted
with air inlet and regulating outlet valves.</p>

<p>Though, of course, vast improvements have been introduced
since Siebe&rsquo;s death, in 1872, the fact remains that his principle is
in universal use to this day. The submarine work which it has
been instrumental in accomplishing is incalculable. But some
idea of the importance of the invention may be gathered from the
fact that diving apparatus on Siebe&rsquo;s principle is universally used
to-day in harbour, dock, pier and breakwater construction, in
the pearl and sponge fisheries, in recovering sunken ships, cargo
and treasure, and that every ship in the British navy and in most
foreign navies carries one set or more of diving apparatus.</p>

<p>A modern set of diving apparatus consists essentially of six
parts:&mdash;(1) an air pump, (2) a helmet with breastplate, (3) a
diving dress, (4)
a pair of heavily
weighted boots,
(5) a pair of back
and chest
weights, (6) a
flexible non-collapsible
air tube.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Air Pumps.</i>&mdash;The
type of air
pump varies with
the depth of water
to which the diver
has to descend; it
will be readily understood
that the
greater the depth
the greater the
quantity of air
required by the
diver. The pattern
most generally
in favour
amongst divers of
all classes is a
three-cylinder
single-acting
pump, which is
suitable for almost
every description
of work which the
diver may be
called upon to
perform, either in
deep or shallow
water. Another
most useful type
is a two-cylinder double-acting pump (figs. 1 and 2), which is
designed to supply two divers working simultaneously in moderate
depths of water, or one diver only in deep water. An air-distributing
arrangement is fitted, whereby, when it is desired to send two men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
down together, each cylinder supplies air independently of the other;
and when it is required to send one diver into deep water, the two
cylinders are connected and the full volume of air from both is
delivered to the one man. The same duty is also performed by a
four-cylinder single-acting pump. Smaller pumps, having one
double-acting or two single-acting cylinders, are also used for
shallow water work.</p>

<p>In most cases these air pumps are worked by manual power;
this method of working is rendered necessary by the fact that the
machines are usually placed in small boats from which the divers
work and on which other motive power is not available. In cases,
however, where steam or electric power is available the pumps are
sometimes worked by their means&mdash;more particularly on harbour
and dock works. In such instances the air is not delivered direct
from the pump to the diver, but is delivered into an intermediate
steel receiver to which the diver&rsquo;s air pipe is connected, the object
being to ensure a reserve supply of air in case of a breakdown of the
pump. Some of these combinations of pumps and motors are so
arranged that, in the event of an accident to the motor, the pump
can be thrown out of gear with it, and be immediately worked by
hand power. Each pump is fitted with a gauge (or gauges), indicating
not only the pressure of air which the pump is supplying,
but also the depth of water at which the diver is working. The
cylinders are water-jacketed to ensure the air delivered to the diver
being cool, the water being drawn in and circulated round the
cylinders by means of a small metal pump worked from an eccentric
on the main crank-shaft. Filters are sometimes attached to the
suction and delivery sides of the pumps to ensure the inlet of air
being free from dirt, and the discharge of air free from dirt and oil.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Pump in chest, ready for work.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Helmet.</i>&mdash;The helmet and breastplate (fig. 3) are made from highly
planished tinned copper, with gun-metal valves and other fittings.
The helmet is provided with a non-return air inlet valve to which the
diver&rsquo;s air pipe is connected; the air when it lifts the inlet valve
passes through three conduits&mdash;one having its outlet over the front
glass, the others their outlets over the side glasses. In this way
the diver gets the air fresh as it enters the helmet, and at the same
time it prevents condensation of his breath on the glasses and keeps
them clear. There is a regulating air outlet valve by which the
diver adjusts his supply of air according to his requirements in different
depths of water; the valve is usually made to be adjusted by hand,
but sometimes it is so constructed as to be operated by the diver
knocking his head against it, the spindle being extended through to
the inside of the helmet and fitted at its inner extremity with a
button or disk. By unscrewing the valve, the diver allows air to
escape, and thus the dress is deflated; by screwing it up the air
is retained and the dress inflated. Thus the diver can control his
specific gravity and rise or sink at will. In case by any chance the
diver should inflate the dress inadvertently, and wish to get rid of the
superfluous air quickly, he can do so by opening an emergency cock,
which is fitted on the helmet. Plate glasses in gun-metal frames are
also fitted to the helmet, two, one on each side, being permanently
fixed, while one in front is made either to screw in and out, or to work
on a hinged joint like a ship&rsquo;s scuttle; the side glasses are usually
protected by metal cross-bars, as is also sometimes the front glass.
Some divers prefer unprotected glasses at the side of the helmet,
instead of protected oval ones.</p>

<p>The breastplate is fitted on its outer edge with metal screws and
bands. The disposition of the screws corresponds with that of the
holes in the india-rubber collar of the diving dress described below.
There are other methods of making a watertight joint between the
diver&rsquo;s breastplate and the diving dress, but, as these are only
mechanical differences, it will suffice to describe the Siebe-Gorman
apparatus, as exclusively adopted by the British government.
Whatever the shape or design of the helmet or dress, Siebe&rsquo;s principle
is the one in universal use to-day.</p>

<p>The metal tabs are for carrying the diver&rsquo;s lead weights, which are
fitted with suitable clips; the hooks&mdash;one on each side of the helmet&mdash;are
for keeping the ropes attached to the back weight in position.
The helmet and breastplate are fitted at their lower and upper parts
respectively with gun-metal segmental neck rings, which make it
possible to connect these two main parts together by one-eighth of
a turn, a catch at the back of the helmet preventing any chance of
unscrewing. The small eyes at the top of the helmet are for securing
the diver&rsquo;s air pipe and life line in position and preventing them from
swaying.</p>

<p>The <i>Diving Dress</i> is a combination suit which envelops the whole
body from feet to neck. It is made of two layers of tanned twill with
pure rubber between, and is fitted at the neck with a vulcanized
india-rubber collar, or band, with holes punched in it corresponding
to the screws in the breastplate. This collar, when clamped tightly
between the bands and the breastplate by means of the nuts, ensures
a watertight joint. The sleeves of the dress are fitted with vulcanized
india-rubber cuffs, which, fitting tightly round the diver&rsquo;s wrists,
prevent the ingress of water at these parts also.</p>

<p><i>Boots.</i>&mdash;These are generally made with leather uppers, beechwood
inner soles and leaden outer soles, the latter being secured to the others
by copper rivets. Heavy leather straps with brass buckles secure
the boot to the foot. Each boot weighs about 16 &#8468;. Sometimes the
main part of the boot-golosh, toe and heel, are in one brass casting,
with leather upper part, heavy straps and brass buckles.</p>

<p><i>Lead Weights.</i>&mdash;These weigh 40 &#8468; each, and the diver wears one
on his back, another on his chest. These weights and the heavy
boots ensure the diver&rsquo;s equilibrium when under water.</p>

<p><i>Belt and Knife and Small Tools.</i>&mdash;Every diver wears a heavy
waist-belt in which he carries a strong knife in metal case, and sometimes
other small tools.</p>

<p><i>Air Pipe.</i>&mdash;The diver&rsquo;s air pipe is of a flexible, non-collapsible
description, being made of alternate layers of strong canvas and
vulcanized india-rubber, with steel or hard drawn metal wire embedded.
At the ends are fitted gun-metal couplings, for connecting
the pipe with the diver&rsquo;s pump and helmet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span></p>

<p><i>Signal Line.</i>&mdash;The diver&rsquo;s signal line (sometimes called life line)
consists of a length of reverse laid Manila rope. In cases where the
telephone apparatus is not used, the diver gives his signals by means
of a series of pulls on the signal line in accordance with a prearranged
code.</p>

<p><i>Telephonic Apparatus.</i>&mdash;Without doubt one of the most useful
adjuncts to the modern diving apparatus is the loud-sounding
telephone (fig. 4), introduced by Siebe, Gorman &amp; Co., which enables
the diver to communicate viva voce with his attendant, and vice
versa. In the British navy the type of submarine telephonic
apparatus used is the Graham-Davis system. This is made on two
plans, (1) a single set of instruments, for communication between
one diver and his attendant direct, (2) an intercommunication set
which is used where two divers are employed. With this type the
attendant can speak to No. 1 or No. 2 diver separately, or with both
at the same time, and vice versa; and No. 1 can be put in communication
with No. 2 whilst they are under water, the attendant at
the surface being able to hear what the men are saying. The
advantages of such a system are obvious. It is more particularly
useful where two divers are working one either side of a ship, or
where the divers may be engaged upon the same piece of work, but
out of sight of one another, or out of touch. It would prove its utility
in a marked degree in cases where a diver got into difficulties; a
second diver sent down to his assistance could receive and give verbal
directions and thus greatly expedite the work of rescue.</p>

Q, Battery, with switch and bell in case.<br />
R, Attendant&rsquo;s receiver and transmitter.</td></tr></table>

<p>The telephone instruments in the helmet consist of one or more
loud-sounding receivers placed either in the crown of the helmet,
or one on each side in close proximity to the diver&rsquo;s ears. A transmitter
of a special watertight pattern is placed between the front
glass and one of the side glasses, and a contact piece, which, when
the diver presses his chin against it, rings a bell at the surface, is
fitted immediately below the front glass. A buzzer is sometimes
fixed in the helmet to call the diver&rsquo;s attention when the attendant
wishes to speak, but as a rule the voice is transmitted so loudly that
this device is unnecessary. A connexion, through which the insulated
wires connecting the instruments pass, terminates in contact pieces,
and the telephone
cable, embedded in
the diver&rsquo;s signal
line, is connected
with it. The other
end of the signal line
is connected to a
battery box at the
surface. This box
contains, besides
the cells, a receiver
and transmitter for
the attendant, an
electric bell, a terminal
box, and a
special switch, by
means of which various
communications
between diver, or
divers, and attendant
are made. If,
as is sometimes the
case, the diver happens
to be somewhat
deaf, he can, whilst
he is taking a message,
stop the vibration
of the outlet
valve and the noise made by the escaping air, by merely pressing
his finger on a spindle which passes through the disk of the valve,
and thus momentarily ensure absolute silence.</p>

<p><i>Speaking Tube.</i>&mdash;The rubber speaking tube which was the forerunner
of the telephonic apparatus is now practically obsolete, though
it is still used in isolated cases.</p>

<p><i>Submarine Electric Lamps.</i>&mdash;Various forms of submarine lamps
are used, from a powerful arc light to a self-contained hand lamp,
the former giving about 2000 or 3000 candle-power, and requiring
a steam-driven dynamo to supply the necessary current, the latter
(fig. 5) giving a light of about 10 candle-power and having its own
batteries, so that the diver carries both the light and its source in
his hand. These submarine lamps are all constructed on the same
principle, having the incandescent lamps, or carbons as the case
may be, enclosed in a strong glass globe, the mechanism and connexions
being fitted in a metal case above the globe, which is flanged
and secured watertightly to the case.</p>

<p><i>Self-contained Diving Dress.</i>&mdash;The object of the self-contained
diving dress is to make the diver independent of air supply from the
surface. The dress, helmet, boots and weights are of the ordinary
pattern already described, but instead of obtaining his air supply
by means of pumps and pipes, the diver is equipped with a knapsack
consisting of a steel cylinder containing oxygen compressed to a
pressure of 120 atmospheres (= about 1800 &#8468;) to the square inch,
and chambers containing caustic soda or caustic potash. The
helmet is connected to the chambers by tubes, and the oxygen
cylinder is similarly connected to the chambers. The breath exhaled
by the diver passes through a valve into the caustic soda, which
absorbs the carbonic acid, and it is then again inhaled through
another valve. This process of regeneration goes on automatically,
the requisite amount of oxygen being restored to the breathed air
in its passage through the chambers. This type of apparatus has
been used for shallow water work, but the great majority of divers
prefer the apparatus using pumps as the source of the air supply.</p>

<p>An emergency dress, using this self-contained system for breathing,
has been designed by Messrs Fleuss and Davis, of the firm of Siebe,
Gorman &amp; Co., primarily as a life-saving apparatus, for enabling men

<p>The helmet diver is indispensable in connexion with harbour and
dock construction, bridge-building, pearl and sponge fishing, wreck
raising and the recovery of sunken cargo and treasure. Every ship
in the British navy carries one set or more of diving apparatus, for
use in ease of emergency, for clearing fouled propellers, cleaning
valves or ship&rsquo;s hull below the water line, repairing hulls if necessary,
and recovering lost anchors, chains, torpedoes, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Greatest Depths attained.</i>&mdash;The greatest depth at which useful
work has been performed by a diver is 182 ft. From this depth
a Spanish diver, Angel Erostarbe, recovered Â£9000 in silver bars
from the wreck of the steamer &ldquo;Skyro,&rdquo; sunk off Cape Finisterre;
Alexander Lambert succeeded in salving Â£70,000 from the
Spanish mail steamer &ldquo;Alphonso XII,&rdquo; sunk in 162 ft. of water
off Las Palmas, Grand Canary; W. Ridyard recovered Â£50,000 in
silver dollars from the &ldquo;Hamilton Mitchell,&rdquo; sunk off Leuconna
Reef, China, in 150 ft. There are individual cases where much
larger sums have been recovered, but those mentioned are
particularly notable by reason of the great depth involved and
stand out as the greatest depths at which good work has
been done. The sponge fishers of the Mediterranean work
at a maximum depth of about 150 ft., and the pearl divers of
Australia at 120 ft. But submarine operations on the great
majority of the harbour and dock works of the world are
conducted at a depth of from 30 to 60 ft.</p>

<p>The weighted tools employed by divers differ very little from
those used by the workmen on <i>terra firma</i>. Pneumatic tools,
worked by compressed air conveyed from the surface through
flexible tubes, are great aids, particularly in rock removal work.
With the rock drill the diver bores a number of holes to a given
depth, inserts in these the charges of dynamite or other explosive
used, attaches one end of a wire to a detonator which is inserted in
the charge, and then comes to the surface. The boat from which
he works is then moved away from the scene of operations, paying
out the wire attached to the detonators, and when at a safe
distance the free end of the wire is connected to a magneto
exploding machine, which is then set in motion.</p>

<p>A complete set of diving apparatus costs from Â£75 to Â£200,
varying with the depth of water for which it is required.</p>

<p>The pay of a diver depends upon the nature of the work upon
which he is engaged, and also upon the depth of the water. On
harbour and dock work the average wage is 2s. to 2s. 6d. per hour;
on wreck work from 3s. to 5s. an hour, according to depth; on
treasure and cargo recovery so much per day, with a percentage
on the value recovered, generally about 5%. The pearl fishers of
Australia get so much per ton of shell, and the sponge fishers are
also paid by results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span></p>

<p>A problem which has been exercising the minds of those
engaged in submarine work is the greatest depth at which it is
possible to work, for, as is well known, many a fine vessel with
valuable cargo and treasure is lying out of reach of the diver owing
to the pressure which he would have to sustain were he to attempt
to reach her. Mr Leonard Hill, and Drs Greenwood and J. J. R.
Macleod conducted experiments in conjunction with Messrs
Siebe, Gorman &amp; Co., with a view to solving this problem, and
their efforts have been attended with some considerable success.
Dr J. S. Haldane has also carried out practical experiments for
the British Admiralty, and under his supervision two naval
officers have succeeded in reaching the unprecedented depth of
210 ft., at which depth the pressure is about 90 &#8468; to the square
inch.</p>

<p><i>Diving Bells.</i>&mdash;Every one is familiar with the experiment of
placing an inverted tumbler in a bowl of water, and seeing the
water excluded from the tumbler by the air inside it. Perhaps it
was to some such experiment as this that the conception of the
diving bell was due. As is well known, the pressure of water
increases with the depth, and for all practical purposes this
pressure can be taken at 4Â¼ &#8468; to every 10 ft. The following
table shows the pressure at different depths below the surface
of the water:&mdash;</p>

<p>If a diving bell be sunk to a depth of, say, 33 ft., the air inside
it will be compressed to about half its original volume, and the bell
itself will be about half filled with water. But if a supply of air be
maintained at a pressure equal to the depth of water at which the
bell is submerged, not only will the water be kept down to the
cutting edge, but the bell will be ventilated and it will be possible
for its occupants to work for hours at a stretch.</p>

<p>Tradition gives Roger Bacon, in 1250, the credit for being
the originator of the diving bell, but actual records are lost in
antiquity. Of the records preserved to us, probably one of the
most trustworthy is an account given in Kaspar Schott&rsquo;s work,
<i>Technica curiosa</i>, published in the year 1664, which quoted from
one John Taisnier, who was in the service of Charles V. This
account describes an experiment which took place at Toledo,
Spain, in the year 1538, before the emperor and some thousands
of spectators, when two Greeks descended into the water in a
large &ldquo;kettle,&rdquo; suspended by ropes, with its mouth downwards.
The &ldquo;kettle&rdquo; was equipoised by lead fixed round its mouth.
The men came up dry, and a lighted candle, which they had
taken down with them, was still burning.</p>

<p>Francis Bacon, in the <i>Novum Organum</i>, lib. ii., makes the
following reference to a machine, or reservoir, of air to which
labourers upon wrecks might resort whenever they required to
take breath:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;A hollow vessel, made of metal, was let down equally to the
surface of the water, and thus carried with it to the bottom of the
sea the whole of the air which it contained. It stood upon three
feet&mdash;like a tripod&mdash;which were in length something less than the
height of a man, so that the diver, when he was no longer able to
contain his breath, could put his head into the vessel, and having
filled his lungs again, return to his work.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>But it was to Dr Edmund Halley, secretary of the Royal
Society, that undoubtedly the honour is due of having invented
the first really practical diving bell. This is described in the
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, 1717, in a paper on &ldquo;The Art of
Living Under Water by means of furnishing air at the bottom of
the sea in any ordinary depth.&rdquo; Halley&rsquo;s bell was constructed of
wood, and was covered with lead, which gave it the necessary
sinking weight, and was so distributed as to ensure that it kept
a perpendicular position when in the water. It was in the form
of a truncated cone, 3 ft. in diameter at the top, 5 ft. at the
bottom and 8 ft. high. In the roof a lens was introduced for
admitting light, and also a tap to let out the vitiated air. Fresh
air was supplied to the bell by means of two lead-lined barrels,
each having a bung-hole in the top and bottom. To the hole in
the top was fixed a leathern tube, weighted in such a manner that
it always fell below the level of the bottom of the barrel so that no
air could escape. When, however, the tube was turned up by the
attendant in the bell, the pressure of the water rising through the
hole in the bottom of the barrel, forced the air through the tube at
the top and into the diving bell. These barrels were raised and
lowered alternately, with such success that Halley says that he,
with four others, remained at the bottom of the sea, at a depth
of 9 to 10 fathoms, for an hour and a half at a time without
inconvenience of any sort.</p>

<p>This type of bell was used by John Smeaton in repairing the
foundations of Hexham Bridge in 1778, but instead of weighted
barrels, he introduced a force pump for supplying the necessary
air. To Smeaton too we are indebted for the first diving bell
plant in the form with which we are familiar to-day, that celebrated
engineer having designed a square bell of iron, for use on
the Ramsgate harbour works, in 1788. This bell, which measured
4Â½ ft. in length, 3 ft. in width and 4Â½ ft. in height, and weighed
2Â½ tons, was made sufficiently heavy to sink by its own weight.
It afforded room enough for two men to work, and was supplied
with air by a force pump worked from a boat at the surface.</p>

<p>Though the diving bell has been largely superseded by the
modern diving apparatus, it is still used on certain classes of
work the magnitude of which justifies the expense entailed, for
it is not only a question of the cost of the bell, but of the
powerful steam-driven crane which is needed to lower and raise
it, and also of the gantry on which the crane travels. Sometimes
a barge or other vessel is used for working the bell.</p>

<p>At the present day, two types of diving bell are employed&mdash;the
ordinary bell, and the air-lock bell, which, however, is not so
largely used.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>On the new national harbour works at Dover, four large diving
bells of the ordinary type (fig. 6) were employed. These bells, in
each of which from four to six men descended at a time, consisted
of steel chambers, open at the bottom, measuring 17 ft. long by
10Â½ ft. wide by 7 ft. high, and each weighed 35 tons. The ballast,
which at once gives the necessary sinking weight to the bell and
maintains its equilibrium, consisted of slabs of cast iron bolted to
the walls of the bell, inside. Each bell was fitted with loud-sounding
telephonic apparatus, by means of which the occupants could communicate
either with the men attending the crane or the men looking
after the air compressors at the surface. Electric lamps, supplied
with current by a dynamo in the compressor room, gave the necessary
light inside the bell. Seats and foot rails were provided for the
men, and there were racks and hooks for the various tools. Suspended
from the roof was an iron skip into which the men threw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
excavated material, which was emptied out when the bell was brought
to the surface. Air was supplied to the bells by means of steam-driven
compressors worked in a house erected on the gantry. The
air was delivered into a steel air receiver, and thence it passed through
a flexible tube connected to a gun-metal inlet valve in the roof of the
diving bell; the pressure of air was regulated according to the depth
at which the bell happened to be working. The maximum depth
on the Dover works was between 60 and 70 ft., = about 25-30 &#8468; to
the square inch. A bell was lowered by means of powerful steam-driven
cranes, travelling on a gantry, to within a few feet of the water,
and the men entered it from a boat. The bell then continued its
descent to the bottom, where the men, with pick and shovel, levelled
the sea bed ready to receive the large concrete blocks, weighing from
30 to 42 tons apiece. Having completed one section, the bell was
moved along to another. The concrete blocks were then lowered and
placed in position by helmet divers. The bell divers, clad in thick
woollen suits and watertight thigh boots, worked in shifts of about
three hours each, and were paid at the rate of from 1s. to 15d.
per hour.</p>

<p>The cost of an ordinary diving bell, including air compressor,
telephonic apparatus and electric light, is from Â£600 to Â£1500,
according to size.</p>

<p>The <i>Air-lock Diving Bell</i> (fig. 7) comprises an iron or steel working
chamber similar to the ordinary diving bell, but with the addition of
a shaft attached to its roof. At the upper end of the shaft is an airtight
door, and about 8 ft. below this is another similar door. When
the bell divers wish to enter the bell, they pass through the first
door and close it after them, and then open a cock or valve and
gradually let into the space between the two doors compressed air
from the working chamber in order to equalize the pressure; they
then open the second door and pass down into the working chamber,
closing the door after them. When returning to the surface they
reverse the operation. It can readily be imagined that, owing to its
unwieldy character, the employment of the air-lock bell is resorted
to only in those cases where the nature of the sea bed necessitates its
remaining on a given spot for some considerable time, as for instance
in the excavation of hard rock to a given depth.</p>

<p>An air-lock bell supplied to the British Admiralty, for use in
connexion with the laying of moorings at Gibraltar, has a working
chamber measuring 15 ft. long by 10Â½ ft. wide, by 7Â½ ft. high, and a
shaft 37Â½ ft. high by 3 ft. in diameter. It is built of steel plates, with
cast-iron ballast, and its total weight is about 46 tons. The bell is
electrically lighted, and is fitted with telephonic apparatus communicating
with the air-compressor room and lifting-winch room.
It is worked through a well in the centre of a specially constructed
steel barge 85 ft. long by 40 ft. beam, having a draught of 7 ft. 6 in.
The wire ropes, for lowering and raising the bell, work over pulleys
which are carried on a superstructure erected over the well. Two
sets of air compressors are fitted on the barge&mdash;one set for supplying
air to the bell, the other set for working a pneumatic rock drill inside
the bell. The greatest depth at which this particular bell will work
is 40 ft. The cost of the whole plant, including barge, was about
Â£14,000.</p>

<p>The diving dress has, however, to a great extent supplanted the
diving bell. This is due not only to the heavier cost of the latter, but
more particularly to the greater mobility of the helmet diver. Bell
divers are naturally limited to the area which their bell for the time
being covers, whereas helmet divers can be distributed over different
parts of a contract and work entirely independently of one another.
The use of the diving bell is, therefore, practically limited to the work
of levelling the sea bed, and the removal of rock.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIVES-SUR-MER,<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> a small port and seaside resort of north-western
France on the coast of the department of Calvados, on
the Dives, 15 m. N.E. of Caen by road. Pop. (1906) 3286. Dives
is celebrated as the harbour whence William the Conqueror sailed
to England in 1066. In the porch of its church (14th and 15th
centuries) a tablet records the names of some of his companions.
The town has a picturesque inn, adapted from a building dating
partly from the 16th century, and market buildings dating from
the 14th to the 16th centuries. The coast in the vicinity of Dives
is fringed with small watering-places, those of Cabourg (to the
west) and of Beuzeval and Houlgate (to the east) being practically
united with it. There are large metallurgical works with electric
motive power close to the town.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIVIDE,<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> a word used technically as a noun in America and the
British colonies for any high ridge between two valleys, forming
a water-parting; a dividing range. For special senses of the
verb &ldquo;to divide&rdquo; (Lat. <i>di-videre</i>, the latter part of the word
coming from a root seen in Lat. <i>vidua</i>, Eng. &ldquo;widow&rdquo;), meaning
generally to split up in two or more parts, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Division</a></span>. In a
parliamentary sense, to divide (involving a separation into two
sides, Aye and No) is to take the sense of the House by voting
on the subject before it.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIVIDEND<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (Lat. <i>dividendum</i>, a thing to be divided), the net
profit periodically divisible among the proprietors of a joint-stock
company in proportion to their respective holdings of its
capital. Dividend is not interest, although the word dividend is
frequently applied to payments of interest; and a failure to pay
dividends to shareholders does not, like a failure to pay interest
on borrowed money, lay a company open to being declared
bankrupt. In bankruptcy a dividend is the proportionate share
of the proceeds of the debtor&rsquo;s estate received by a creditor. In
England, the Companies Act 1862 provided that no dividend
should be payable except out of the profits arising from the business
of the company, but, in the case of companies incorporated by
special act of parliament for the construction of railways and
other public works which cannot be completed for a considerable
time, it is sometimes provided that interest may during construction
be paid to the subscribers for shares out of capital. Dividends
(excluding occasional distributions in the form of shares) are
ordinarily payable in cash. Most companies divide their capital
into at least two classes, called &ldquo;preference&rdquo; shares and
&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; shares, of which the former are entitled out of the
profits of the company to a preferential dividend at a fixed
rate, and the latter to whatever remains after payment of the
preferential dividend and any fixed charges. Before, however, a
dividend is paid, a part of the profits is often carried to a &ldquo;reserve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
fund.&rdquo; The dividend on preference shares is either &ldquo;cumulative&rdquo;
or contingent on the profits of each separate year or half year.
When cumulative, if the profits of any one year are insufficient
to pay it in full, the deficiency has to be made good out of subsequent
profits. A cumulative preferential dividend is sometimes
said to be &ldquo;guaranteed,&rdquo; and preferential dividends payable by
all English companies registered under the Companies Acts 1862
to 1908 are cumulative unless stipulated to be otherwise. Certain
public companies are forbidden by parliament to pay dividends in
excess of a prescribed maximum rate, but this restriction has
been happily modified in some instances, notably in the case of
gas companies, by the institution of a sliding scale, under which a
gas company may so regulate the price of gas to be charged to
consumers that any reduction of an authorized standard price
entitles the company to make a proportionate increase of the
authorized dividend, and any increase above the standard price
involves a proportionate decrease of dividend. Dividends are
usually declared yearly or half-yearly; and before any dividend
can be paid it is, as a rule, necessary for the directors to submit
to the shareholders, at a general meeting called for the purpose,
the accounts of the company, with a report by the directors on its
position and their recommendation as to the rate of the proposed
dividend. The articles of association of a company usually
provide that the shareholders may accept the director&rsquo;s recommendation
as to dividend or may declare a lower one, but may
not declare a higher one than the directors recommend. Directors
frequently have power to pay on account of the dividend for the
year, without consulting the shareholders, an &ldquo;interim dividend,&rdquo;
which on ordinary shares is generally at a much lower rate than
the final or regular dividend. An exceptionally high dividend
is often distributed in the shape of a dividend at the usual rate
supplemented by an additional dividend or &ldquo;bonus.&rdquo; Payment
of dividends is made by means of cheques sent by post, called
&ldquo;dividend warrants.&rdquo; All dividends are subject to income-tax,
and by most companies dividends are paid &ldquo;less income-tax,&rdquo;
in which case the tax is deducted from the amount of dividend
payable to each proprietor. When paid without such deduction
a dividend is said to be &ldquo;free of income-tax.&rdquo; In the latter case,
however, the company has to make provision for payment of the
tax before declaring the dividend, and the amount of its divisible
profits and the rate of dividend which it is able to declare are
consequently to that extent reduced. In respect of consols and
certain other securities, holders of amounts of less than Â£1000 may
instruct the Bank of England or Bank of Ireland to receive and
invest their dividends. With few exceptions, the prices of
securities dealt in on the London Stock Exchange include any
accruing dividend not paid up to the date of purchase. At a
certain day, after the dividend is declared, the stock or share is
dealt in on the Stock Exchange, as <i>ex dividend</i> (or &ldquo;x. d.&rdquo;), which
means that the current dividend is paid not to the buyer but
to the previous holder, and the price of the stock is lower to that
extent. The expression &ldquo;cum dividend&rdquo; is used to signify that
the price of the security dealt in includes a dividend which, in
the absence of any stipulation, might be supposed to belong to
the seller of the security. On the New York Stock Exchange the
invariable practice is to sell stock with the &ldquo;dividend on&rdquo; until
the company&rsquo;s books are closed, after which it is usually sold
&ldquo;ex dividend.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIVIDIVI,<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> the native and commercial name for the astringent

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIVINATION<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span>, the process of obtaining knowledge of secret or
future things by means of oracles, omens or astrology. The root
of the word, <i>deus</i> (god) or <i>divus</i>, indicates the supposed source of
the soothsayer&rsquo;s information, just as the equivalent Greek term,
<span class="grk" title="mantikÃª">&#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span>, indicates the spiritual source of the utterances of the seer,
<span class="grk" title="mantis">&#956;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span>. In classical times the view was, in fact, general, as may
be seen by Cicero&rsquo;s <i>De divinatione</i>, that not only oracles but also
omens were signs sent by the gods; even the astrologer held that
he gained his information, in the last resort, from the same source.
On the side of the Stoics it was argued that if divination was a real
art, there must be gods who gave it to mankind; against this
it was argued that signs of future events may be given without
any god.</p>

<p>Divination is practised in all grades of culture; its votaries
range from the Australian black to the American medium. There
is no general agreement as to the source of the information;
commonly it is held that it comes from the gods directly or
indirectly. In the Bornean cult of the hawk it seems that the
divine bird itself was regarded as having a foreknowledge of
the future. Later it is regarded as no more than a messenger.
Among the Australian blacks, divination is largely employed to
discover the cause of death, where it is assumed to be due to
magic; in some cases the spirit of the dead man is held to give
the information, in others the living magician is the source of the
knowledge. We find moreover a semi-scientific conception of the
basis of divination; the whole of nature is linked together; just
as the variations in the height of a column of mercury serve to
foretell the weather, so the flight of birds or behaviour of cattle
may help to prognosticate its changes; for the uncultured it is
merely a step to the assumption that animals know things which
are hidden from man. Haruspication, or the inspection of
entrails, was justified on similar grounds, and in the case of omens
from birds or animals, no less than in astrology, it was held that
the facts from which inferences were drawn were themselves in
part the causes of the events which they foretold, thus fortifying
the belief in the possibility of divination.</p>

<p>From a psychological point of view divinatory methods may be
classified under two main heads: (A) autoscopic, which depend
simply on some change in the consciousness of the soothsayer;
(B) heteroscopic, in which he looks outside himself for guidance
and perhaps infers rather than divines in the proper sense.</p>

<p>(A) Autoscopic methods depend on (i.) sensory or (ii.) motor
automatisms, or (iii.) mental impressions, for their results.
(i.) Crystal-gazing (<i>q.v.</i>) is a world-wide method of divining, which
is analogous to dreams, save that the vision is voluntarily initiated,
though little, if at all, under the control of the scryer. Corresponding
to crystal-gazing we have <i>shell-hearing</i> and similar
methods, which are, however, less common; in these the information
is gained by hearing a voice. (ii.) The divining rod (<i>q.v.</i>) is
the best-known example of this class; divination depending on
automatic movements of this sort is found at all stages of culture;
in Australia it is used to detect the magician who has caused the
death of a native; in medieval and modern times water-divining
or <i>dowsing</i> has been largely and successfully used. Similar in
principle is <i>coscinomancy</i>, or divining by a sieve held suspended,
which gives indications by turning; and the equally common
divination by a suspended ring, both of which are found from
Europe in the west to China and Japan in the east. The ordeal by
the Bible and key is equally popular; the book is suspended by a
key tied in with its wards between the leaves and supported on
two persons&rsquo; fingers, and the whole turns round when the name of
the guilty person is mentioned. Confined to higher cultures on
the other hand, for obvious reasons, is divination by automatic
writing, which is practised in China more especially. The sand
divination so widely spread in Africa seems to be of a different
nature. <i>Trance speaking</i>, on the other hand, may be found in any
stage of culture and there is no doubt that in many cases the
procedure of the magician or shaman induces a state of auto-hypnotism;
at a higher stage these utterances are termed oracles
and are believed to be the result of inspiration (<i>q.v.</i>). (iii.) Another
method of divination is by the aid of mental impressions;
observation seems to show that by some process of this sort, akin
to clairvoyance (<i>q.v.</i>), fortunes are told successfully by means of
palmistry or by laying the cards; for the same &ldquo;lie&rdquo; of the cards
may be diversely interpreted to meet different cases. In other
cases the impression is involuntary or less consciously sought,
as in dreams (<i>q.v.</i>), which, however, are sometimes induced, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
purposes of divination, by the process known as incubation or
temple sleep. Dreams are sometimes regarded as visits to or
from gods or the souls of the dead, sometimes as signs to be
interpreted symbolically by means of dream-books, which are
found not only in Europe but in less cultured countries like Siam.</p>

<p>(B) In heteroscopic divination the process is rather one of
inference from external facts. The methods are very various.
(i.) The casting of lots, <i>sortilege</i>, was common in classical
antiquity; the Homeric heroes prayed to the gods when they cast
lots in Agamemnon&rsquo;s leather cap, and Mopsus divined with sacred
lots when the Argonauts embarked. Similarly dice are thrown
for purposes of sortilege; the <i>astragali</i> or knucklebones, used
in children&rsquo;s games at the present day, were implements of
divination in the first instance. In Polynesia the coco-nut is
spun like a teetotum to discover a thief. Somewhat different are
the omens drawn from books; in ancient times the poets were
often consulted, more especially Virgil, whence the name <i>sortes
virgilianae</i>, just as the Bible is used for drawing texts in our own
day, especially in Germany. (ii.) In <i>haruspication</i>, or the inspection
of entrails, in <i>scapulomancy</i> or divination by the speal-bone
or shoulder-blade, in divination by footprints in ashes, found
in Australia, Peru and Scotland, the voluntary element is
prominent, for the diviner must take active steps to secure the
conditions necessary to divination. (iii.) In the case of <i>augury</i>
and <i>omens</i>, on the other hand, that is not necessary. The
behaviour and cries of birds, and <i>angang</i> or meeting with ominous
animals, &amp;c., may be voluntarily observed, and opportunities for
observation made; but this is not necessary for success. (iv.) In
<i>astrology</i> we have a method which still finds believers among
people of good education. The stars are held, not only to prognosticate
the future but also to influence it; the child born when
Mars is in the ascendant will be war-like; Venus has to do with
love; the sign of the Lion presides over places where wild beasts
are found. (v.) In other cases the tie that binds the subject of
divination with the omen-giving object is sympathy. The name
of the life-index is given to a tree, animal or other object believed
to be so closely united by sympathetic ties to a human being that
the fate of the latter is reflected in the condition of the former.
The Polynesians set up sticks to see if the warriors they stood
for were to fall in battle; on Hallowe&rsquo;en in our own country the
behaviour of nuts and other objects thrown into the fire is held to
prognosticate the lot of the person to whom they have been
assigned. Where, as in the last two cases, the sympathetic
bond is less strong, we find symbolical interpretation playing
an important part.</p>

<p>Sympathy and symbolism, association of ideas and analogy,
together with a certain amount of observation, are the explanation
of the great mass of heteroscopic divinatory formulae. But
where autoscopic phenomena play the chief part the question of
the origin of divination is less simple. The investigations of the
Society for Psychical Research show that premonitions, though
rare in our own day, are not absolutely unknown. Pseudo-premonitions,
due to hallucinatory memory, are not unknown;
there is also some ground for holding that crystal-gazers are able
to perceive incidents which are happening at a distance from
them. Divination of this sort, therefore, may be due to observation
and experiment of a rude sort, rather than to the unchecked
play of fancy which resulted in heteroscopic divination.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIVINING-ROD.<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> As indicated in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Magic</a></span>,
<i>Rhabdomancy</i>, or the art of using a divining-rod for discovering
something hidden, is apparently of immemorial antiquity, and
the Roman <i>virgula divina</i>, as used in taking auguries by means of
casting bits of stick, is described by Cicero and Tacitus (see also
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Divination</a></span>); but the special form of <i>virgula furcata</i>, or forked
twig of hazel or willow (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hazel</a></span>), described by G. Agricola
(<i>De re metallica</i>, 1546), and in Sebastian Munster&rsquo;s <i>Cosmography</i>
in the early part of the 16th century, used specially for discovering
metallic lodes or water beneath the earth, must be distinguished
from the general superstition. The &ldquo;dowsing&rdquo; or divining-rod,
in this sense, has a modern interest, dating from its use by
prospectors for minerals in the German (Harz Mountains) mining
districts; the French chemist M.E. Chevreul<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> assigns its first
mention to Basil Valentine, the alchemist of the late 15th century.
On account of its supposed magical powers, it may be taken
perhaps as an historical analogue to such fairy wands as the
<i>caduceus</i> of Mercury, the golden arrow of Herodotus&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abaris
the Hyperborean,&rdquo; or the medieval witch&rsquo;s broomstick. But
the existence of the modern water-finder or dowser makes the
divining-rod a matter of more than mythological or superstitious
interest. The <i>Schlagruthe</i> (striking-rod), or forked twig of the
German miners, was brought to England by those engaged in the
Cornish mines by the merchant venturers of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
day. Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S., the chief modern investigator
of this subject, regards its employment, dating as it
does from the revival of learning, as based on the medieval
doctrine of &ldquo;sympathy,&rdquo; the drooping of trees and character of
the vegetation being considered to give indications of mineral
lodes beneath the earth&rsquo;s surface, by means of a sort of attraction;
and such critical works as Robert Boyle&rsquo;s (1663), or the
<i>Mineralogia Cornubiensis</i> of Pryce (1778), admitted its value in
discovering metals. But as mining declined in Cornwall, the use
of the dowser for searching for lodes almost disappeared, and was
transferred to water-finding. The divining-rod has, however,
also been used for searching for any buried objects. In the south
of France, in the 17th century, it was employed in tracking
criminals and heretics. Its abuse led to a decree of the Inquisition
in 1701, forbidding its employment for purposes of justice.</p>

<p>In modern times the professional dowser is a &ldquo;water-finder,&rdquo;
and there has been a good deal of investigation into the possibility
of a scientific explanation of his claims to be able to locate underground
water, where it is not known to exist, by the use of a
forked hazel-twig which, twisting in his hands, leads him by its
directing-power to the place where a boring should be made.
Whether justified or not, a widespread faith exists, based no doubt
on frequent success, in the dowser&rsquo;s power; and Professor
Barrett (<i>The Times</i>, January 21, 1905) states that &ldquo;making
a liberal allowance for failures of which I have not heard, I have
no hesitation in saying that where fissure water exists and the
discovery of underground water sufficient for a domestic supply
is a matter of the utmost difficulty, the chances of success with a
good dowser far exceed mere lucky hits, or the success obtained
by the most skilful observer, even with full knowledge of the local
geology.&rdquo; Is this due to any special faculty in the dowser, or
has the twig itself anything to do with it? Held in balanced
equilibrium, the forked twig, in the dowser&rsquo;s hands, moves with a
sudden and often violent motion, and the appearance of actual
life in the twig itself, though regarded as mere stage-play by
some, is popularly associated with the cause of the water-finder&rsquo;s
success. The theory that there is any direct connexion
(&ldquo;sympathy&rdquo; or electrical influence) between the divining-rod
and the water or metal, is however repudiated by modern science.
Professor Barrett, who with Professor Janet and others is satisfied
that the rod twists without any intention or voluntary deception
on the part of the dowser, ascribes the phenomenon to &ldquo;motor-automatism&rdquo;
on the part of the dowser (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Automatism</a></span>), a
reflex action excited by some stimulus upon his mind, which may
be either a subconscious suggestion or an actual impression
(obscure in its nature) from an external object or an external
mind; both sorts of stimulus are possible, so that the dowser
himself may make false inferences (and fail) by supposing that
the stimulus is an external object (like water). The divining-rod
being thus &ldquo;an indicator of any sub-conscious suggestion or
impression,&rdquo; its indications, no doubt, may be fallacious; but
Professor Barrett, basing his conclusions upon observed successes
and their greater proportion to failures than anything that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
chance could produce, advances the hypothesis that some persons
(like the professional dowsers) possess &ldquo;a genuine super-normal
perceptive faculty,&rdquo; and that the mind of a good dowser, possessing
the idiosyncrasy of motor-automatism, becomes a blank or
<i>tabula rasa</i>, so that &ldquo;the faintest impression made by the object
searched for creates an involuntary or automatic motion of the
indicator, whatever it may be.&rdquo; Like the &ldquo;homing instinct&rdquo; of
certain birds and animals, the dowser&rsquo;s power lies beneath the
level of any conscious perception; and the function of the forked
twig is to act as an index of some material or other mental
disturbance within him, which otherwise he could not interpret.</p>

<p>It should be added that dowsers do not always use any rod.
Some again use a willow rod, or withy, others a hazel-twig (the
traditional material), others a beech or holly twig, or one from
any other tree; others even a piece of wire or watch-spring. The
best dowsers are said to have been generally more or less illiterate
men, usually engaged in some humble vocation.</p>

<p>Sir W. H. Preece (<i>The Times</i>, January 16, 1905), repudiating
as an electrician the theory that any electric force is involved,
has recorded his opinion that water-finding by a dowser is due to
&ldquo;mechanical vibration, set up by the friction of moving water,
acting upon the sensitive ventral diaphragm of certain exceptionally
delicately framed persons.&rdquo; Another theory is that water-finders
are &ldquo;exceptionally sensitive to hygrometric influences.&rdquo;
In any case, modern science approaches the problem as one
concerning which the facts have to be accepted, and explained
by some natural, though obscure, cause.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIVISION<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>dividere</i>, to break up into parts, separate),
a general term for the action of breaking up a whole into parts.
Thus, in political economy, the phrase &ldquo;division of labour&rdquo;
implies the assignment to particular workmen of the various
portions of a whole piece of work; in mathematics division is
the process of finding how many times one number or quantity,
the &ldquo;divisor,&rdquo; is contained in another, the &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arithmetic</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Algebra</a></span>); in the musical terminology of the
17th and 18th centuries, the term was used for rapid passages
consisting of a few slow notes amplified into a florid passage,
<i>i.e.</i> into a larger number of quick ones. The word is used also in
concrete senses for the parts into which a thing is divided, <i>e.g.</i> a
division of an army, an administrative or electoral division;
similarly, a &ldquo;division&rdquo; is taken in a legislative body when votes
are recorded for and against a proposed measure.</p>

<p>In logic, division is a technical term for the process by which
a <i>genus</i> is broken up into its <i>species</i>. Thus the genus &ldquo;animal&rdquo;
may be divided, according to the habitat of the various kinds,
into animals which live on land, those which live in water, those
which live in the air. Each of these may be subdivided according
to whether their constituent members do or do not possess certain
other qualities. The basis of each of these divisions is called the
<i>fundamentum divisionis</i>. It is clear that there can be no division
in respect of those qualities which make the genus what it is.
The various species are all alike in the possession of the generic
attributes, but differ in other respects; they are &ldquo;variations on
the same theme&rdquo; (Joseph, <i>Introduction to Logic</i>, 1906); each one
has the generic, and also certain peculiar, qualities (<i>differentiae</i>),
which latter distinguish them from other species of the same
genus. The process of division is thus the obverse of classification
(<i>q.v.</i>); it proceeds from genus to species, whereas classification
begins with the particulars and rises through species to genus. In
the exact sciences, and indeed in all argument both practical
and theoretical, accurate division is of great importance. It is
governed by the following rules. (1) <i>Division must be exhaustive</i>;
all the members of the genus must find a place in one or other of
the species; a captain who selects for his team skilful batsmen
and bowlers only is guilty of an incomplete division of the whole
function of a cricket team by omitting to provide himself with
good fielders. Rectilinear figures cannot be divided into triangles
and quadrilaterals because there are rectilinear figures which
have more than four sides. On the other hand, triangles can be
divided into equilateral, isosceles and scalene, since no other kind
of triangle can exist. (2) Division <i>must be exclusive</i>, that is, each
species must be complete in itself and not contain members of
another species. No member of a genus must be included in more
than one of the species. (3) In every division <i>there must be but one
principle (fundamentum divisionis)</i>. The members of a genus
may differ from one another in many respects, <i>e.g.</i> books may
be divided according to external form into quarto, octavo, &amp;c.,
or according to binding into calf, cloth, paper-backed and so on.
They cannot, however, be divided logically into quarto, paper-backed,
novels and remainders. When more than one principle is
used in a division it is called &ldquo;cross division.&rdquo; (4) <i>Division must
proceed gradually</i> (&ldquo;Divisio non facit saltum&rdquo;), <i>i.e.</i> the genus
must be resolved into the next highest (&ldquo;proximate&rdquo;) species.
To go straight from a <i>summum genus</i> to very small species is of no
scientific value.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that logical division is concerned exclusively
with universals or concepts; division is of genus and species, not
of particulars. Two other kinds of division are recognized:&mdash;<i>metaphysical
division</i>, the separation in thought of the various
qualities possessed by an individual thing (a piece of lead has
weight, colour, &amp;c), and <i>physical division</i> or <i>partition</i>, the
breaking up of an object into its parts (a watch is thought of
as being composed of case, dial, works, &amp;c.). Logical division is
closely allied with logical definition (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIVORCE<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (Lat. <i>divortium</i>, derived from dis-, apart, and
vertere, to turn), the dissolution, in whole or in part, of the tie
of marriage. It includes both the complete abrogation of the
marriage relation known as a divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i>, which
carries with it a power on the part of both parties to the marriage
to remarry other persons or each other, and also that incomplete
severance not involving powers to remarry, which was formerly
known as divorce a <i>mensa et thoro</i>, and has in England been termed
&ldquo;judicial separation.&rdquo; Less strictly, divorce is commonly understood
to include judicial declarations of nullity of marriage, which,
while practically terminating the marriage relation, proceed in
law on the basis of the marriage never having been legally
established.</p>

<p>The conditions under which, in different communities, divorce
has at different times been permitted, vary with the aspects in
which the relation of marriage (<i>q.v.</i>) has been regarded. When
marriage has been deemed to be the acquisition by the husband
of property in the wife, or when it has been regarded as a mere
agreement between persons capable both to form and to dissolve
that contract, we find that marriage has been dissoluble at the
will of the husband, or by agreement of the husband and wife.
Yet even in these cases the interest of the whole community in
the purity of marriage relations, in the pecuniary bearings of this
particular contract, and the condition of children, has led to the
imposition of restrictions on, and the attachment of conditions to,
the termination of the obligations consequent on a marriage
legally contracted. But the main restrictions on liberty of divorce
have arisen from the conception of marriage entertained by
religions, and especially by one religion. Christianity has had no
greater practical effect on the life of mankind than in its belief
that marriage is no mere civil contract, but a vow in the sight
of God binding the parties by obligations of conscience above
and beyond those of civil law. Translating this conception into
practice, Christianity not only profoundly modified the legal
conditions of divorce as formulated in the Roman civil law, but
in its own canon law defined its own rule of divorce, going so far
as in the Western (at least in its unreformed condition), though
not the Eastern, branch of Christendom to forbid all complete
divorces, that is to say, all dissolutions of marriage carrying with
them the right to remarry.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">History</p>

<p><i>The Roman Law of Divorce before Justinian.</i>&mdash;The history of
divorce, therefore, practically begins with the law of Rome. It
took its earliest colour from that conception of the <i>patria potestas</i>,
or the power of the head of the family over its members, which
enters so deeply into the jurisprudence of ancient Rome. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>
wife was transferred at marriage to the authority of her husband,
<i>in manus</i>, and consequently became so far subject to him that
he could, at his will, renounce his rule over her, and terminate his
companionship, subject at least to an adjustment of the pecuniary
rights which were disturbed by such action. So clearly was the
power of the husband derived from that of the father, that for a
long period a father, in the exercise of his <i>potestas</i>, could take his
daughter from her husband against the wishes of both. It may
be presumed that this power, anomalous as it appears, was not
unexercised, as we find that a constitution of Antoninus Pius
prohibited a father from disturbing a harmonious union, and
Marcus Aurelius afterwards limited this prohibition by allowing
the interference of a father for strong and just cause&mdash;<i>magna et
justa causa interveniente</i>. Except in so far as it was restrained
by special legislation, the authority of a husband in the matter
of divorce was absolute. As early indeed, however, as the time of
Romulus, it is said that the state asserted its interest in the
permanence of marriage by forbidding the repudiation of wives
unless they were guilty of adultery or of drinking wine, on pain of
forfeiture of the whole of an offender&rsquo;s property, one-half of which
went to the wife, the other to Ceres. But the law of the XII.
Tables, in turn, allowed freedom of divorce. It would appear,
however, that the sense of the community was so far shocked by
the inhumanity of treating a wife as mere property, or the risk of
regarding marriage as a mere terminable contract, that, without
crystallizing into positive enactment, it operated to prevent the
exercise of so harsh and dangerous a power. It is said that for
500 years no husband took advantage of his power, and it
was then only by an order of a censor, however obtained, that
Spurius Carvilius Ruga repudiated his wife for barrenness. We
may, however, be permitted to doubt the genuineness of this
censorial order, or at least to conjecture the influence under which
the censor was induced to intervene, when we find that in another
instance, that of L. Antonius, a censor punished an unjust divorce
by expulsion from the senate, and that the exercise of their power
by husbands increased to a great and alarming extent. Probably
few of the admirers of the greatest of Roman orators have not
regretted his summary and wholly informal repudiation of
Terentia. At last the <i>lex Julia de adulteriis</i>, while recognizing a
power of divorce both in the husband and in the wife, imposed on
it, in the public interest, serious restrictions and consequences.
It required a written bill of divorce (<i>libellus repudii</i>) to be given
in the presence of seven witnesses, who must be Roman citizens
of age, and the divorce must be publicly registered. The act was,
however, purely an act of the party performing it, and no idea of
judicial interference or contract seems to have been entertained.
It was not necessary for either husband or wife giving the bill to
acquaint the other with it before its execution, though it was
considered proper to deliver the bill, when made, to the other
party. In this way a wife could divorce a lunatic husband, or the
<i>paterfamilias</i> of a lunatic wife could divorce her from her husband.
But the <i>lex Julia</i> was also the first of a series of enactments by
which pecuniary consequences were imposed on divorce both by
husbands and wives, whether the intention was to restrain divorce
by penalties of this nature, or to readjust pecuniary relations
settled on the basis of marriage and disturbed by its rupture. It
was provided that if the wife was guilty of adultery, her husband
in divorcing her could retain one-sixth of her <i>dos</i>, but if she had
committed a less serious offence, one-eighth. If the husband was
guilty of adultery, he had to make immediate restitution of her
dowry, or if it consisted of land, the annual proceeds for three
years; if he was guilty of a less serious offence, he had six months
within which to restore the <i>dos</i>. If both parties were in fault, no
penalty fell on either. The <i>lex Julia</i> was followed by a series of
acts of legislation extending and modifying its provisions. The
legislation of Constantine, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 331, specified certain causes for
which alone a divorce could take place without the imposition of
pecuniary penalties. There were three causes for which a wife
could divorce her husband with impunity: (1) murder, (2)
preparation of poisons, (3) violation of tombs; but if she divorced
him for any other cause, such as drunkenness, or gambling or
immoral society, she forfeited her dowry and incurred the further
penalty of deportation. There were also three causes for which a
husband could divorce his wife without incurring any penalty:
(1) adultery, (2) preparation of poisons, (3) acting as a procuress.
If he divorced her for any other cause, he forfeited all interest in
her dowry; and if he married again, the first wife could take the
dowry of the second.</p>

<p>In <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 421 the emperors Honorius and Theodosius enacted
a law of divorce which introduced limitations on the power of
remarriage as an additional penalty in certain cases. As regards a
wife: (1) if she divorced her husband for grave reasons or crime,
she retained her dowry and could remarry after five years;
(2) if she divorced him for criminal conduct or moderate faults,
she forfeited her dowry, became incapable of remarriage, and liable
to deportation, nor could the emperor&rsquo;s prerogative of pardon be
exerted in her favour. As regards a husband: if he divorced his
wife (1) for serious crime, he retained the dowry and could remarry
immediately; (2) for criminal conduct, he did not retain
the dowry, but could remarry; (3) for mere dislike, he forfeited
the property brought into the marriage and could not
remarry.</p>

<p>In <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 449 the law of divorce was rendered simpler and
certainly more facile by Theodosius and Valentinian. It was
provided that a wife could divorce her husband without incurring
any penalty if he was convicted of any one of twelve offences:
(1) treason, (2) adultery, (3) homicide, (4) poisoning, (5) forgery,
(6) violating tombs, (7) stealing from a church, (8) robbery,
(9) cattle-stealing, (10) attempting his wife&rsquo;s life, (11) beating his
wife, (12) introducing immoral women to his house. If the wife
divorced her husband for any other cause, she forfeited her dowry,
and could not marry again for five years. A husband could
divorce his wife without incurring a penalty for any of these
reasons except the last, and also for the following reasons:
(1) going to dine with men other than her relations without
the knowledge or against the wish of her husband; (2) going
from home at night against his wish without reasonable
cause; (3) frequenting the circus, theatre or amphitheatre
after being forbidden by her husband. If a husband divorced
his wife for any other reason, he forfeited all interest in his
wife&rsquo;s dowry, and also any property he brought into the
marriage.</p>

<p>The above sketch of the legislation prior to the time of
Justinian, while it indicates a desire to place the husband and wife
on something like terms of equality as regards divorce, indicates
also, by its forbidding remarriage and by its pecuniary provisions
in certain cases, a sense in the community of the importance in
the public interest of restraining the violation of the contract of
marriage. But to the Roman marriage was primarily a contract,
and therefore side by side with this legislation there always
existed a power of divorce by mutual consent. We must now
turn to those principles of the Christian religion which, in
combination with the legislation above described, produced
the law formulated by Justinian.</p>

<p><i>The Christian View of Divorce.</i>&mdash;The Christian law of divorce
as enunciated by its Founder was expressed in a few words,
but these, unfortunately, by no means of agreed interpretation.
To appreciate them it is necessary to consider the enactment of
the Mosaic law, which also was expressed in few words, but of a
meaning involved in much doubt. The phrase in Deut. xxiv. 1-4,
which is translated in the Authorized Version &ldquo;some uncleanness,&rdquo;
but in the Revised Version, &ldquo;some unseemly thing,&rdquo; and
which is the only cause stated to justify the giving of a &ldquo;bill of
divorcement,&rdquo; was limited by the school of Shanmai to moral
delinquency, but was extended by the rival school of Hillel to
causes of trifling importance or even to motives of caprice. The
wider interpretation would seem to be supported by the words
of Christ (Matt. v. 31), who, in indicating His own doctrine in
contradistinction to the law of Moses, said, &ldquo;Whosoever shall put
away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication (<span class="grk" title="porneias">&#960;&#959;&#961;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>),
causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her
that is divorced committeth adultery.&rdquo; The meaning of these
words of Christ Himself has been involved in controversy, which
perhaps was nowhere carried on with greater acuteness or under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
more critical conditions than within the walls of the British
parliament during the passage of the Divorce Act of 1857. That
they justify divorce of a complete kind for moral delinquency
of some nature is supported by the opinion probably of every
competent scholar. But scholars of eminence have sought
to restrict the meaning of the <span class="grk" title="logos porneias">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#961;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> to antenuptial
incontinence concealed from the husband, and to exclude
adultery. The effect of this view commends itself to the adherents
of the Church of Rome, because it places the right to separation
between husband and wife, not on a cause supervening after
a marriage, which that Church seeks to regard as absolutely
indissoluble, but on invalidity in the contract of marriage itself,
and which may therefore render the marriage liable to be declared
void without impugning its indissoluble character when rightly
contracted. The narrower view of the meaning of <span class="grk" title="logos porneias">&#960;&#959;&#961;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> has
been maintained by, among others, Dr DÃ¶llinger (<i>First Ages of the
Church</i>, ii. 226); but those who will consider the arguments of
Professor Conington in reply to Dr DÃ¶llinger (<i>Contemp. Review</i>,
May 1869) will probably assign the palm to the English scholar.
A more general view points in the same direction. It is quite true
that under the Mosaic law antenuptial incontinence was, as was
also adultery, punishable with death. But when we consider
the effect of adultery not only as a moral fault, but as violating
the solemn contract of marriage and vitiating its objects, it is
inconceivable that Christ, in employing a term of general import,
intended to limit it to one kind, and that the less serious, of
incontinence.</p>

<p><i>Effect of Christianity on the Law of Rome.</i>&mdash;The modification
in the civil law of Rome effected by Justinian under the joint
influence of the previous law of Rome and that of Christianity
was remarkable. Gibbon has summed up the change effected in
the law of Rome with characteristic accuracy: &ldquo;The Christian
princes were the first who specified the just causes of a private
divorce; their institutions from Constantine to Justinian appear
to fluctuate between the customs of the empire and the wishes of
the Church; and the author of the Novels too frequently reforms
the jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects.&rdquo; Divorce by mutual
consent, hitherto, as we have seen, absolutely free, was prohibited
(Nov. 117) except in three cases: (1) when the husband was
impotent; (2) when either husband or wife desired to enter a
monastery; and (3) when either of them was in captivity for a
certain length of time. It is obvious that the two first of these
exceptions might well commend themselves to the mind of the
Church, the former as being rather a matter of nullity of marriage
than of divorce, the latter as admitting the paramount claims of
the Church on its adherents, and not inconsistent with the spirit
of the words of St Paul himself, who clearly contemplated a
separation between husband and wife as allowable in case either
of them did not hold the Christian faith (1 Cor. vii. 12). At a later
period Justinian placed a further restriction or even prohibition
on divorce by consent by enacting that spouses dissolving a
marriage by mutual consent should forfeit all their property, and
be confined for life in a monastery, which was to receive one-third
of the forfeited property, the remaining two-thirds going to the
children of the marriage. The cause stated for this remarkable
alteration of the law, and the abandonment of the conception of
marriage as a civil contract <i>ut non Dei judicium contemnatur</i>
(Nov. 134), indicates the influence of the Christian idea of
marriage. That influence, however, did not long continue in its
full force. The prohibitions of Justinian on divorce by consent
were repealed by Justin (Nov. 140), his successor. &ldquo;He yielded,&rdquo;
says Gibbon, &ldquo;to the prayers of his unhappy subjects, and
restored the liberty of divorce by mutual consent; the civilians
were unanimous, the theologians were divided, and the ambiguous
word which contains the precept of Christ is flexible to any interpretation
that the wisdom of a legislature can demand.&rdquo; It was
difficult, the enactment stated, &ldquo;to reconcile those who once
came to hate each other, and who, if compelled to live together,
frequently attempted each other&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Justinian further re-enacted, with some modifications, the
power of divorce by a husband or wife against the will of the other.
Divorce by a wife was allowed in five cases (Nov. 117): (1) the
husband being party or privy to conspiracy against the state;
(2) attempting his wife&rsquo;s life, or failing to disclose to her plots
against it; (3) attempting to induce his wife to commit adultery;
(4) accusing his wife falsely of adultery; (5) taking a woman to
live in the house with his wife, or, after warning, frequenting
a house in the same town with any woman other than his wife.
If a wife divorced her husband for one of these reasons, she
recovered her dowry and any property brought into the marriage
by her husband for life with reversion to her children, or if there
were no children, absolutely. But if she divorced him for any
other reason, the provisions of the enactment of Theodosius and
Valentinian were to apply. A husband was allowed to divorce his
wife for any one of seven reasons: (1) failure to disclose to her
husband plots against the state; (2) adultery; (3) attempting or
failing to disclose plots against her husband&rsquo;s life; (4) frequenting
dinners or balls with other men against her husband&rsquo;s wishes;
(5) remaining from home against the wishes of her husband
except with her parents; (6) going to the circus, theatre or
amphitheatre without the knowledge or contrary to the prohibition
of her husband; (7) procuring abortion. If the husband
divorced his wife for any one of these reasons he retained the
dowry absolutely, or if there were children, with reversion
to them. If he divorced her for any other reason, the enactments
of Theodosius and Valentinian applied. In any case of
a divorce, if the father or mother of either spouse had advanced
the dowry and it would be forfeited by an unreasonable divorce,
the consent of the father or mother was necessary to render
the divorce valid.</p>

<p><i>Effect of Divorce on Children in the Law of Rome.</i>&mdash;The custody
of the children of divorced parents was dealt with by the Roman
law in a liberal manner. A constitution of Diocletian and
Maximian left it to the judge to determine in his discretion to
which of the parents the children should go. Justinian enacted
that divorce should not impair the rights of children either as to
inheritance or maintenance. If a wife divorced her husband for
good cause, and she remained unmarried, the children were to be
in her custody, but to be maintained by the father; but if the
mother was in fault, the father obtained the custody. If he was
unable, from want of means, to support them, but she was able
to do so, she was obliged to take them and support them. It is
interesting to compare these provisions as to <span class="correction" title="amended from childern">children</span> with the
practice at present under English law, which in this respect
reflects so closely the spirit of the law of Rome.</p>

<p><i>The Canon Law of Divorce.</i>&mdash;The canon law of Rome was based
on two main principles: (1) That there could be no divorce a
<i>vinculo matrimonii</i>, but only <i>a mensa et thoro</i>. The rule was stated
in the most absolute terms: <i>&rdquo;Quamdiu vivit vir licet adulter sit,
licet sodomita, licet flagitiis omnibus coopertus, et ab uxore propter
haec scelera derelictus, maritus ejus reputatur, cui alterum vivum
accipere non licet&rdquo;</i> (Caus. 32, Quaest. 7, c. 7). (2) That no
divorce could be had at the will of the parties, but only by the
sentence of a competent, that is to say, an ecclesiastical, court.
In this negation of a right to divorce a <i>vinculo matrimonii</i> lies
the broad difference between the doctrines of the Eastern and
Western Churches of Christendom. The Greek Church, understanding
the words of Christ in the broader sense above mentioned,
has always allowed complete divorce with a right to remarry for
the cause of adultery. And it is said that the form at least of
an anathema of the council of Trent was modified out of respect
to difference on the part of the Greek Church (see Pothier 5. 6. 21).
The papal canon law allowed a divorce a <i>mensa et thoro</i> for six
causes: (1) adultery or unnatural offences; (2) impotency;
(3) cruelty; (4) infidelity; (5) entering into religion; (6) consanguinity.
The Church, however, always assumed to itself
the right to grant licences for an absolute divorce; and further,
by claiming the power to declare marriages null and void,
though professedly this could be done only in cases where
the original contract could be said to be void, it was, and
is to this day, undoubtedly extended in practice to cases in
which it is impossible to suppose the original contract really
void, but in which a complete divorce is on other grounds
desirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span></p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">Divorce in England</p>

<p>In England the law of divorce, originally based on the canon
law of Rome, underwent some, though little, permanent change
at the Reformation, but was profoundly modified by the exercise
of the power of the state through legislation. From the canon
law was derived the principle that divorce could legally take
place only by sentence of the court, and never at the will of the
parties. Complete divorce has never been governed by any other
principle than this; and in so far as an incomplete divorce has
become practicable at the will of the parties, it has been by the
intervention of civil tribunals and contrary to the law of the
ecclesiastical courts. Those courts adopted as ground for divorce
<i>a mensa et thoro</i> the main grounds allowed by Roman canon law,
adultery and cruelty (Ayliffe, 22; Co. Lit. 102; 1 Salk. 162;
Godolphin Abridg. 495). The causes of heresy and of entering
into religion, if ever they were recognized in England, ceased to
exist at the Reformation.</p>

<p>The principles upon which the English ecclesiastical courts
proceeded in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> are those which are still in
force, and which (with some modification by statutory enactment)
have been administered by judicial tribunals down to the present
day. The courts by which the ecclesiastical law, and therefore
the law of divorce, was administered were, until 1857, the courts
of the various dioceses, including that of the archbishop of
Canterbury, known as the Court of Arches, and that of the archbishop
of York, known as the Consistory Court of York; but by
statute a suitor was prevented from taking proceedings in any
court except that determined by the residence of the person
against whom proceedings were taken (23 Hen. VIII. c. 9). From
these courts an appeal lay to delegates appointed in each case by
the crown, until the establishment of the judicial committee of
the privy council in 1836, when the appeal was given to the crown
as advised by that body.</p>

<p>The proof of adultery (to which Isidore in his <i>Book of Etymologies</i>
gives the fanciful derivation of &ldquo;<i>ad alterius thorum</i>&rdquo;)
was not by the canon law as received in England restricted by the
operation of arbitrary rules. It was never, for example, required,
as by the law of Mahomet, that the act should have been actually
seen by competent witnesses, nor even that the case should be
based on any particular kind of proof. It was recognized that the
nature of the offence almost inevitably precluded direct evidence.
One rule, however, appears to have commended itself to the
framers of the canon law as too general in its application not to
be regarded as a principle. The mere confession of the parties
was not regarded as a safe ground of conviction; and this rule
was formulated by a decretal epistle of Pope Celestine III., and,
following it, by the 105th of the Canons of 1604. This rule has
now been abrogated; and no doubt it is wiser not to fetter the
discretion of the tribunal charged with the responsibility of deciding
particular cases, but experience of divorce proceedings tends
to confirm the belief that this rule of the canon law was founded
on an accurate appreciation of human nature.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, with the above exception, no strict rules
of the evidence necessary to establish adultery have ever been
established in the English courts, experience has indicated, and
in former days judges of the ecclesiastical courts often expressed,
the lines upon which such proof may be expected to proceed. It
is necessary and sufficient, in general, to prove two things&mdash;first
the guilty affection towards each other of the persons accused,
and, secondly, an opportunity or opportunities of which, if so
minded, their passion may have been gratified. It is obvious that
any strong proof on either of these points renders strict proof on
the other less needful; but when proof on both is afforded, the
common sense of a tribunal, acting with a knowledge of human
nature, may be trusted to draw the inevitable conclusion.</p>

<p>The definition of cruelty accepted by the ecclesiastical courts
as that of the canon law is the same as that which prevails at
the present time; and the view of the law taken by the House of
Lords in <i>Russell</i> v. <i>Russell</i> (1897 App. Cas. 395) was expressly
based on the view of cruelty taken by the authorities of the
ecclesiastical law. The best definition by older English writers
is probably to be found in Clarke&rsquo;s <i>Praxis</i> (p. 144): &ldquo;Si maritus
fuerit erga uxorem crudelis et ferax ac mortem comminatus et
machinatus fuerit, vel eam inhumaniter verbis et verberibus
tractaverit, et aliquando venenum loco potus paraverit vel
aliquod simile commiserit, propter quod sine periculo vitae
cum marito cohabitare aut obsequia conjugalia impendere
non audeat ... consimili etiam causa competit viro contra
mulierem.&rdquo; Lord Stowell, probably the greatest master of the
civil and canon law who ever sat in an English court of justice,
has in one of his most famous judgments (<i>Evans</i> v. <i>Evans</i>, 1790,
1 Hagg. <i>Consist.</i> 35) echoed the above language in words often
quoted, which have constituted the standard exposition of the
law to the present day. &ldquo;In the older cases,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of this
sort which I have had the opportunity of looking into, I have
observed that the danger of life, limb or health is usually insisted
as the ground upon which the court has proceeded to a separation.
This doctrine has been repeatedly applied by the court in the
cases which have been cited. The court has never been driven
off this ground. It has always been jealous of the inconvenience
of departing from it, and I have heard no one case cited in which
the court has granted a divorce without proof given of a reasonable
apprehension of bodily hurt. I say an apprehension, because
assuredly the court is not to wait till the hurt is actually done;
but the apprehension must be reasonable: it must not be an
apprehension arising from an exquisite and diseased sensibility of
mind. Petty vexations applied to such a constitution of mind
may certainly in time wear out the animal machine, but still
they are not cases of legal relief; people must relieve themselves
as well as they can by prudent resistance, by calling in the
succours of religion and the consolation of friends; but the aid of
courts is not to be resorted to in such cases with any effect.&rdquo; The
risk of personal danger in cohabitation constituted, therefore,
the foundation of legal cruelty. But this does not exclude such
conduct as a course of persistent ill-treatment, though not
amounting to personal violence, especially if such ill-treatment
has in fact caused injury to health. But the person complaining
must not be the author of his or her own wrong. If, accordingly,
one of the spouses by his or her conduct is really the cause of the
conduct complained of, recourse to the court would be had in vain,
the true remedy lying in a reformation of the real cause of the
disagreement.</p>

<p>In addition to a denial of the charge or charges, the canon law
allowed three grounds of answer: (1) <i>Compensatio criminis</i>, a setoff
of equal guilt or recrimination. This principle is no doubt
derived from the Roman law and it had the effect of refusing to
one guilty spouse the remedy of divorce against the other although
equally guilty. It was always accepted in England, although
not in other countries, such as France and Scotland, which also
followed the canon or civil law. In strictness, recrimination
applied to a similar offence having been committed by the party
charging that offence. But a decision (1888) of the English
courts shows that a wife who had committed adultery could not
bring a suit against her husband for cruelty (<i>Otway</i> v. <i>Otway</i> 13 P.
D. 141). (2) <i>Condonation.</i> If the complaining spouse has, in fact,
forgiven the offence complained of, that constitutes a conditional
bar to any proceedings. The main and usual evidence of such
forgiveness is constituted by a renewal of marital intercourse,
and it is difficult-perhaps impossible-to imagine any case in
which such intercourse would not be held to establish condonation.
But condonation may be proved by other acts, or by words,
having regard to the circumstances of each case. Condonation
is, however, always presumed to be conditional on future good
behaviour, and misconduct even of a different kind revives the
former offence. (3) <i>Connivance</i> constitutes a complete answer to
any charge. Nor need the husband be the active agent of the
misconduct of the wife. Indifference or neglect imputable to a
corrupt intention are sufficient. It will be seen presently that
modern statute law has gone further in this direction. It is to be
added that the connivance need not be of the very act complained
of, but may be of an act of a similar kind. A learned judge,
recalling the classical anecdote of Maecenas and Galba, said, &ldquo;A
husband is not permitted to say <i>non omnibus dormio</i>.&rdquo; The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
ecclesiastical courts also considered themselves bound to refuse
relief if there was shown to be <i>collusion</i> between the parties. In
its primary and most general sense collusion was understood to be
an agreement between the parties for the purpose of deceiving the
court by false or fictitious evidence; for example, an agreement
to commit, or appear to commit, an act of adultery. Collusion,
however, is not limited to the imposing of other than genuine
evidence on the court. It extends to an agreement to withhold
any material evidence; and indeed is carried further, and held to
extend to any agreement which may have the effect of concealing
the real and complete truth from the court (see <i>Churchward</i> v.
<i>Churchward</i>, 1894, p. 161). This doctrine was of considerable
importance even in the days when only divorces <i>a mensa et thoro</i>
were granted, because at that time the parties were not permitted
to separate by consent. At the present day it has become, with
regard to divorce a <i>vinculo matrimonii</i>, a rule of greater and of
more far-reaching importance.</p>

<p>The canon law as accepted in England, while allowing divorces
of the nature and for the causes above mentioned, actively interfered
to prevent separation between husband and wife in any
other manner. A suit known as a suit for restitution of conjugal
rights could be brought to compel cohabitation; and on evidence
of the desertion of either spouse, the court ordered a return to
the matrimonial home, though it carried no further its authority
as to the matrimonial relations within the home. To this suit an
agreement between the parties constituted no answer. But an
answer was afforded by any conduct which would have supported
a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>. It is a question whether,
indeed, the ecclesiastical courts would not have gone further, and
refused a decree of restitution of conjugal rights on grounds which
might appear adequate to justify such refusal, though not
sufficient on which to ground a decree of divorce. The view of the
court of appeal and the House of Lords has given some colour to
this opinion, and certainly the court of appeal has held, although
perhaps somewhat hastily, that the effect of a modern statute has
been to allow the court to refuse restitution of conjugal rights for
causes falling short of what would constitute ground for divorce
(<i>Russell</i> v. <i>Russell</i>, 1895, p. 315).</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical courts provided for the pecuniary rights of
the wife by granting to her alimony during the progress of the suit,
and a proper allowance after its termination in cases in which she
was successful. Such payments were dependent on the pecuniary
means, or <i>faculties</i>, as they were termed, of the husband, and were
subject to subsequent increase or diminution in proper cases.
But the ecclesiastical courts did not deal with the custody of
the children of the marriage, it being probably considered that
that matter could be determined by the common law rights of
the father, or by the intervention of the court of chancery.</p>

<p>The canon law fixed no period of limitation, either in respect of
a suit for divorce or for restitution of conjugal rights; but, as
regards at least suits for divorce, any substantial delay might lead
to the imputation of acquiescence or even condonation. To that
extent, at least, the maxim <i>vigilantibus non dormientibus jura
subveniunt</i> applied.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that desertion by either party to a marriage,
except as giving rise to a suit for restitution, was not treated as an
offence by canon law in England. It formed no ground for a suit
for divorce, and constituted no answer to such a suit by way of
recrimination. It might indeed deprive a husband of his remedy
if it amounted to connivance, or perhaps even if it amounted only
to culpable neglect.</p>

<p>The canon law, as administered in England, has kept clear the
logical distinction which exists between dissolving a marriage and
declaring it null and void. The result has been that, in England
at least, the two proceedings have never been allowed to pass into
one another, and a complete divorce has not been granted on
pretence of a cause really one for declaring the marriage void <i>ab
initio</i>. But for certain causes the courts were prepared to declare
a marriage null and void on the suit of either party. There is,
indeed, a distinction to be drawn between a marriage void or only
voidable, though in both cases it became the subject of a similar
declaration. It was void in the cases of incapacity of the parties
to contract it, arising from want of proper age, or consanguinity,
or from a previous marriage, or from absence of consent, a state
of things which would arise if the marriage were compelled by
force or induced by fraud as to the nature of the contract entered
into or the personality of the parties. It is to be remarked that,
in England at least, the idea of fraud as connected with the
solemnization of marriage has been kept within these narrow
limits. Fraud of a different kind, such as deception as to the
property or position of the husband or wife, or antecedent
impurity of the wife, even if resulting in a concealed pregnancy,
has not in England (though the last-mentioned cause has in other
countries) been held a ground for the vitiation of a marriage
contract. A marriage was voidable, and could be declared void,
on the ground of physical incapacity of either spouse, the absence
of intercourse between the parties after a sufficient period of
opportunity being almost, if not quite, conclusive on this subject.</p>

<p>With regard to one cause of nullity the legislation interfered
from consideration, it is said, of a case of special hardship.
Before the Marriage Act of 1835 marriages within the prohibited
degrees of consanguinity and affinity were only voidable by a
decree of the court, and remained valid unless challenged during
the lifetime of both the parties. But this act, while providing
that no previous marriage between persons within the prohibited
degrees should be annulled by a decree of the ecclesiastical
court pronounced in a suit depending at the time of the passing
of the act, went on to render all such marriages thereafter contracted
in England &ldquo;absolutely null and void to all intents and
purposes whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another suit was allowed by the ecclesiastical courts which
should be mentioned, although its bearing on divorce is indirect.
This was the suit for <i>jactitation of marriage</i>, which in the case
of any person falsely asserting his or her marriage to another,
allowed such person to be put to perpetual silence by an order
of the court. This suit, which has been of rare occurrence
(though there was an instance, <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>Rourke</i>, in 1892),
does not appear to have been used for the purpose of determining
the validity of a marriage. The legislature, has, however, in the
Legitimacy Declaration Act of 1858, provided a ready means by
which the validity of marriages and the legitimacy of children
can be determined, and the procedure provided has repeatedly
been utilised.</p>

<p>It should be added, as a matter closely akin to the proceedings
in the ecclesiastical courts, that the common law took cognizance
of one phase of matrimonial relations by allowing an action by
the husband against a paramour, known as an action for criminal
conversation. In such an action a husband could recover
damages estimated according to the loss he was supposed to have
sustained by the seduction and loss of his wife, the punishment
of the seducer not being altogether excluded from consideration.
Although this action was not unfrequently (and indeed, for the
purposes of a divorce, necessarily) brought, it was one which
naturally was regarded with disfavour.</p>

<p><i>Effect of the Reformation.</i>&mdash;Great as was the indirect effect of
the Reformation upon the law of divorce in England, the direct
effect was small. It might, indeed, have been supposed that the
disappearance of the sacramental idea of marriage entertained by
the Roman Church would have ushered in the greater freedom
of divorce which had been associated with marriage regarded
as a civil contract. And to some extent this was the case. It
was for some time supposed that the sentences of divorce
pronounced by the ecclesiastical courts acquired the effect
of allowing remarriage, and such divorces were in some cases
granted. In <i>Lord Northampton&rsquo;s</i> case in the reign of Edward VI.
the delegates pronounced in favour of a second marriage after a
divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>. It was, however, finally decided in
<i>Foljambe&rsquo;s</i> case, in the 44th year of Elizabeth, that a marriage
validly contracted could not be dissolved for any cause. But
the growing sense of the right to a complete divorce for adequate
cause, when no longer any religious law to the contrary could
be validly asserted, in time compelled the discovery of a remedy.
The commission appointed by Henry VIII. and Edward VI. to
reform the ecclesiastical law drew up the elaborate report known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span>
as the <i>Reformatio Legum</i>, and in this they recommended that
divorces <i>a mensa et thoro</i> should be abolished, and in their place
complete divorce allowed for the causes of adultery, desertion
and cruelty. These proposals, however, never became law. In
1669 a private act of parliament was granted in the case of Lord
de Roos, and this was followed by another in the case of the duke
of Norfolk in 1692. Such acts were, however, rare until the
accession of the House of Hanover, only five acts passing before
that period. Afterwards their number considerably increased.
Between 1715 and 1775 there were sixty such acts, in the next
twenty-five years there were seventy-four, and between 1800 and
1850 there were ninety. In 1829 alone there were seven, and in
1830 nine.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction thus assumed by parliament to grant absolute
divorces was exercised with great care. The case was fully
investigated before a committee of the House of Lords, and not
only was the substance of justice so secured, but the House of
Lords further required that application to parliament should be
preceded by a successful suit in the ecclesiastical courts resulting
in a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, and in the case of a husband
being the applicant, a successful action at common law and the
recovery of damages against the paramour. In this way, and
also, if needful, on its own initiative, the House of Lords provided
that there should be no connivance or collusion. Care was also
taken that a proper allowance was secured to the wife in cases
in which she was not the offending party. This procedure is still
pursued in the case of Irish divorces.</p>

<p>It is obvious, however, that the necessity for costly proceedings
before the Houses of Parliament imposed great hardship on the
mass of the population, and there can be little doubt that this
hardship was deeply felt. Repeated proposals were made to
parliament with a view to reform of the law, and more than one
commission reported on the subject. It is said that the final
impetus was given by an address to a prisoner by Mr Justice
Maule. The prisoner&rsquo;s wife had deserted him with her paramour,
and he married again during her lifetime. He was indicted for
bigamy, and convicted, and Mr Justice Maule sentenced him in
the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;Prisoner at the bar: You have been
convicted of the offence of bigamy, that is to say, of marrying
a woman while you had a wife still alive, though it is true she
has deserted you and is living in adultery with another man.
You have, therefore, committed a crime against the laws of your
country, and you have also acted under a very serious misapprehension
of the course which you ought to have pursued. You
should have gone to the ecclesiastical court and there obtained
against your wife a decree <i>a mensa et thoro</i>. You should then
have brought an action in the courts of common law and recovered,
as no doubt you would have recovered, damages against
your wife&rsquo;s paramour. Armed with these decrees, you should
have approached the legislature and obtained an act of parliament
which would have rendered you free and legally competent to
marry the person whom you have taken on yourself to marry
with no such sanction. It is quite true that these proceedings
would have cost you many hundreds of pounds, whereas you
probably have not as many pence. But the law knows no distinction
between rich and poor. The sentence of the court upon
you, therefore, is that you be imprisoned for one day, which
period has already been exceeded, as you have been in custody
since the commencement of the assizes.&rdquo; The grave irony of the
learned judge was felt to represent truly a state of things well-nigh
intolerable, and a reform in the law of divorce was felt to be
inevitable. The hour and the man came in 1857, the man in the
person of Sir Richard Bethell (afterwards Lord Westbury), then
attorney-general.</p>

<p><i>The Act of 1857.</i>&mdash;Probably few measures have been conceived
with such consummate skill and knowledge, and few conducted
through parliament with such dexterity and determination.
The leading opponent of the measure was Mr Gladstone, backed
by the zeal of the High Church party and inspired by his own
matchless subtlety and resource. But the contest proved to be
unequal, and after debates in which every line, almost every word,
of the measure was hotly contested, especially in the House of
Commons, the measure emerged substantially as it had been
introduced. Not the least part of the merit and success of the
act of 1857 is due to the skill which, while effecting a great social
change, did so with the smallest possible amount of innovation.
The act (which came into operation on the 1st of January 1858)
embodied two main principles: 1. The constitution of a lay
court for the administration of all matters connected with
divorce. 2. The transfer to that court, with as little change as
possible, of the powers exercised in matrimonial matters by
(a) the House of Lords, (b) the ecclesiastical courts, (c) the courts
of common law.</p>

<p><i>The Constitution of the Court.</i>&mdash;The new court, termed &ldquo;The
Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes,&rdquo; was constituted by
the lord chancellor, the chiefs and the senior puisne judges of the
three courts of common law, and the judge of the court of probate
(which was also established in 1857), but the functions of the
court were practically entrusted to the judge of the court of
probate, termed the &ldquo;Judge Ordinary,&rdquo; who thus in matters
of probate and divorce became the representative of the former
ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The judge ordinary was empowered
either to sit alone or with one or more of the other judges to
constitute a full court. The parties to a suit obtained the right
of trial by jury of all disputed questions of fact; and the rules
of evidence of the common law courts were made to apply.
An appeal to the full court was given in all matters, which the
judge ordinary was enabled to hear sitting alone.</p>

<p>1. To this court were transferred all the powers of the ecclesiastical
courts with regard to suits for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, to
which the name was given of suits for &ldquo;judicial separation,&rdquo;
nullity, restitution of conjugal rights, and jactitation of marriage,
and in all such proceedings it was expressly enacted (sec. 22) that
the court should act on principles and rules as nearly as possible
conformable to the principles and rules of the ecclesiastical
courts. Judicial separation could be obtained by either husband
or wife for adultery, or cruelty, or desertion continued for two
or more years.</p>

<p>2. There were also transferred to the court powers equivalent
to those exercised by the legislature in granting absolute divorce.
The husband could obtain a divorce for adultery, the wife could
obtain a divorce for adultery coupled with cruelty or desertion
for two or more years, and also for incestuous or bigamous
adultery, or rape, or unnatural offences. The same conditions
as had been required by the legislature were insisted on. A
petition for dissolution (sec. 30) was to be dismissed in case of
connivance, condonation or collusion; and further, the court
had power, though it was not compelled, to dismiss such petition
if the petitioner had been guilty of adultery, or if there had been
unreasonable delay in presenting or prosecuting the petition, or
if the petitioner had been guilty of cruelty or desertion without
reasonable excuse, or of wilful neglect or misconduct conducing
to the adultery. The exercise of these discretionary powers of
the court, just and valuable as they undoubtedly are, has been
attended with some difficulty. But the view of the legislature
has on the whole been understood to be that the adultery of a
petitioner should not constitute a bar to his or her proceeding,
if it has been caused by the misconduct of the respondent, and
that cruelty should not constitute such a bar unless it has caused
or contributed to the misconduct of the respondent. But the
court, while regarding its powers as those of a judicial and not
an arbitrary discretion, has declined to fetter itself by any fixed
rule of interpretation or practice.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that this act assigned a new force to
desertion. The ecclesiastical law regarded it only as suggestive
of connivance or culpable neglect. But the act of 1857 made it
(1) a ground of judicial separation if continued for two years,
(2) a ground in part of dissolution of marriage if continued for
the same period, (3) a bar, in the discretion of the court, to a
petition for dissolution, though it was not made in a similar way
any bar to a suit for judicial separation. It is also to be observed
that the act was confined to causes of divorce recognized by the
ecclesiastical law as administered in England. It did not either
extend the causes of a suit for nullity by adding such grounds as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
antenuptial incontinence, even if accompanied with pregnancy,
nor did it borrow from the civil law of Rome either lunacy or
crime as grounds for divorce.</p>

<p>Much comment has been made on the different grounds on
which divorce is allowed to a husband and to a wife,&mdash;it being
necessary to prove infidelity in both cases, but a wife being
compelled to show either an aggravation of that offence or an
addition to it. Opinions probably will always differ whether the
two sexes should be placed on an equality in this respect, abstract
justice being invoked, and the idea of marriage as a mere contract
pointing in one direction, and social considerations in the other.
But the reason of the legislature for making the distinction is
clear. It is that the wife is entitled to an absolute divorce only
if her reconciliation with her husband is neither to be expected
nor desired. This was no doubt the view taken by the House of
Lords. In 1801 a Mrs Addison claimed an absolute divorce on
the ground of her husband&rsquo;s incest with her sister. The matter
was long debated, but Lord Thurlow, who appeared in the House
of Lords for the last time in order to support the bill, turned the
scale by arguing that it was improper that the wife should under
such circumstances return to her husband (see Campbell, <i>Lives
of the Chancellors</i>, vii. 145). &ldquo;Why do you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;grant to
the husband a divorce for the adultery of the wife? Because he
ought not to forgive her, and separation is inevitable. Where
the wife cannot forgive, and separation is inevitable by reason
of the crime of the husband, the wife is entitled to the like
remedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The act (sec. 32) provided, in case of dissolution, for maintenance
of the wife by the husband on principles similar to those
recognized by the ecclesiastical courts, and (sec. 45) for the settlement
of the property of a guilty wife on her husband or children;
but this enactment was imperfect, as provision was made only
for a settlement and not for payment of an allowance, and none
was made for altering settlements made in view or in consequence
of a marriage. The act (sec. 35) provides also in all divorce
proceedings, and also in those of nullity, for provision for the
custody, maintenance and education of children by the court:
provisions of great value, which were unfortunately for some
time limited by an erroneous view of the court that the age of the
children to which such provisions applied should be considered
limited to sixteen. The act of 1857 also transferred to the new
court the powers exercised by the common law courts in the
action for criminal conversation. It was made obligatory to join
an alleged adulterer in the suit, and damages (sec. 33) might be
claimed against him, and he might be ordered to pay the cost
of the proceedings (sec. 34), the extent depending upon the
circumstances of each case.<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The act of 1857 in one respect went beyond a transfer of the
powers exercised by the ecclesiastical courts or the legislature.
It provided (sec. 21) that a wife deserted by her husband might
apply to a magistrate in petty sessions and obtain an order
which had the effect of protecting her earnings and property,
and during the currency of such order of protection a wife was
to be in the same position as if she had obtained an order for
judicial separation. The effect of this section appears to have
been small; but the Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women) Act
1895 has afforded a cheap and speedy remedy to all classes.</p>

<p>The framers of the act of 1857 were careful to avoid offending
the scruples of clergymen who disapproved of the complete
dissolution of marriage by a lay court. It was provided (secs.
57 and 58) that no clergyman should be compelled to solemnize
the marriage of any person whose former marriage had been
dissolved on the ground of his or her adultery, but should permit
any other clergyman to solemnize the marriage in any church or
chapel in which the parties were entitled to be married. It is
to be feared that this concession, ample as it appears, has not
allayed conscientious objections, which are perhaps from their
nature insuperable. The act made no provision as to the name
to be borne by a wife after a divorce; and this omission led to
litigation in the case of a peer&rsquo;s wife, in <i>Cowley</i> v. <i>Cowley</i>, in which
Lady Cowley was allowed to retain her status.</p>

<p><i>Modifications of the Act of 1857.</i>&mdash;Subsequent legislation has
made good many of the defects of the act of 1857. In 1859
power was given to the court, after a decree of dissolution or of
nullity of marriage, to inquire into the existence of ante- and
post-nuptial settlements, and to make orders with respect to the
property settled either for the benefit of children of the marriage
or their parents; and a subsequent act (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 19, s. 3)
removed a doubt which was entertained whether these powers
could be exercised if there were no children of the marriage. In
1860 a very important change was made, having for its object a
practical mode of preventing divorces in cases of connivance and
collusion or of misconduct of the petitioner. It was provided
that a claim of dissolution (a provision afterwards extended to
decrees of nullity) should in the first instance be a decree nisi,
which should not be made absolute until the expiration of a period
then fixed at not less than three, but by subsequent legislation
enlarged to not less than six, months. During the interval which
elapsed between the decree nisi and such decree being made
absolute, power was given to any person to intervene in the suit
and show cause why the decree should not be made absolute,
by reason of the same having been obtained by collusion, or by
reason of material facts not brought before the court; and it
was also provided that, at any time before the decree was made
absolute, the queen&rsquo;s proctor, if led to suspect that the parties
were acting in collusion for the purpose of obtaining a divorce
contrary to the justice of the case, might under the direction of
the attorney-general intervene and allege such case of collusion.
This enactment (extended in the year 1873 to suits for nullity)
was ill drawn and unskilfully conceived. The power given to
any person whomsoever to intervene is no doubt too wide, and
practically has had little or no useful effect as employed by friends
or enemies of parties to a suit. The limitation in terms of the
express power of the queen&rsquo;s proctor to intervene in cases of
collusion was undoubtedly too narrow. But the queen&rsquo;s proctor,
or the official by whom that officer was afterwards represented,
has in practice availed himself of the general authority given to
any person to show cause why a decree <i>nisi</i> should not be made
absolute, and has thus been enabled to render such important
service to the administration of justice that it is difficult to
imagine the due execution of the law of divorce by a court without
such assistance. By the Matrimonial Causes Act 1866
power was given to the court to order an allowance to be paid by
a guilty husband to a wife on a dissolution of marriage. This
act also can hardly be considered to have been drawn with
sufficient care, inasmuch as while it provides that if the husband&rsquo;s
means diminish, the allowance may be diminished or suspended,
it makes no corresponding provision for increase of the allowance
if the husband&rsquo;s means increase; nor, apparently, does it permit
of an allowance in addition to, but only in substitution for, a
settlement. The act makes no provision for allowance to a guilty
wife, and it certainly is a serious defect that the power to grant
an allowance does not extend to cases of nullity. In 1868 an
appeal to the House of Lords was given in cases of decree for
dissolution or nullity of marriage.</p>

<p>The great changes effected by the Judicature Acts included the
court for divorce and matrimonial causes. Under their operation
a division of the high court of justice was constituted, under the
designation of the probate division and admiralty division, to
which was assigned that class of legal administration governed
mainly by the principles and practice of the canon and civil law.
The division consists of a president, and a justice of the high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span>
court, with registrars representing each branch of the jurisdiction.
Appeals lie to the court of appeal, and thence to the
House of Lords.</p>

<p>In 1884 the legislature interfered to prevent imprisonment
being the result of disobedience to an order for restitution of
conjugal rights. That mode of enforcing the order of the court
was abolished, and the matter was left to a proper adjustment
of the pecuniary relations of the husband and wife; and a
respondent disobeying such an order was held to be guilty
of desertion without reasonable cause, such desertion having
further given to it a similar effect to that assigned to desertion
for two years or upwards. The effect of this provision has been
that the suit for restitution of conjugal rights is most frequently
brought for the purpose of shortening the time within which a
wife can obtain a decree for dissolution of marriage.</p>

<p>Proceedings in the divorce court have shown the improvement
in the law of evidence which has been effected with regard to other
legal proceedings. The act of 1857 made an inroad on the
former law, which prohibited evidence being given by parties
interested in the proceedings, by allowing a petitioner (sec. 43)
to be called and examined by order of the court, absolving such
petitioner, however, from the necessity of answering any question
tending to show that he or she had been guilty of adultery. In
the next year power was given to the court to dismiss any person,
with whom a party to the suit was alleged to have committed
adultery, from the suit if there should not appear to be sufficient
evidence against him or her, the object being to allow such
person to give evidence; and in 1859 it was provided that, on
a petition by a wife for a divorce on the grounds of cruelty or
desertion with adultery, the husband and wife could be competent
and compellable witnesses as to the cruelty or desertion. A few
years later, however, in 1869, the subject was finally dealt with
by repealing all previous rules which limited the powers to give
evidence on questions of adultery with the safeguard that no
witness in any proceeding can be asked or bound to answer any
question tending to show that he or she has been guilty of
adultery, unless in the same proceeding such witness shall have
given evidence in disproof of his or her alleged adultery. It
has been held that the principles of these enactments apply to
interrogatories as well as to evidence given in court.</p>

<p>It is a most remarkable omission in the act of 1857, especially
when we remember the high legal authority from whom it proceeded,
that the act nowhere defines the class of persons with
regard to whom the jurisdiction of the court should be exercised.
This omission has given rise to a misapprehension of the law
which, though now set at rest, prevailed for a considerable period,
and has undoubtedly led to the granting of divorce in several
cases in which it could not legally be given. It was supposed
that the court could grant a dissolution of marriage to all persons
who had anything more than a casual and fleeting residence
within the jurisdiction of the court; and this view, although its
correctness was doubted by Lord Penzance, the judge of the
divorce court, was upheld by a majority of the judges of the court
of appeal in the case of <i>Niboyet</i> v. <i>Niboyet</i> (4 P. D. 1). It was
supposed that such residence gave what was termed a matrimonial
domicile. But this view was undoubtedly erroneous as
regards dissolution of marriage, although probably correct as
regards judicial separation, and the true view is no doubt that
indicated with great learning and ability by Lord Watson in a
judgment given by him in the privy council in the case of <i>Le
Mesurier</i> v. <i>Le Mesurier</i> (1895, App. Cas. 517), that the only
true test of jurisdiction for a decree of divorce altering the
status of the parties to a marriage is to be found in the domicile
of the spouses&mdash;that is to say, of the husband, as the domicile
of a wife follows that of her husband&mdash;at the time of the divorce.
Domicile means a person&rsquo;s permanent home, the place at which
he resides with no intention of making his home elsewhere, and,
if he leaves it, with the intention of returning to it.</p>

<p>It is now also clearly recognized as the law of England that the
English courts will not recognize a divorce purporting to be made
by a foreign tribunal with regard to persons domiciled in England.
For a considerable time doubt appears to have clouded the law
on this subject. In a famous case known as <i>Lolley&rsquo;s</i> case, decided
in 1812, the judges of England (the point arose in connexion with
a criminal charge) unanimously held &ldquo;that no sentence or act
of any foreign country or any state could dissolve an English
marriage <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> for grounds on which it was not
liable to be dissolved <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> in England.&rdquo; This
case has been frequently understood as deciding that a marriage
celebrated in England cannot be dissolved elsewhere, and on
this point the courts of Scotland differ from the view supposed
to be taken by the English judges. But the matter has been fully
explained in one of the most masterly of Lord Hannen&rsquo;s judgments
(<i>Harvey</i> v. <i>Fairnie</i>, 5. P. D. 154), afterwards upheld by
the House of Lords in 1882 (8 App. Cas. 43); and it is now clear
that while the parties are domiciled in this country no decree
of any foreign court dissolving their marriage will be recognized
here, unless it proceed on the grounds on which a divorce may
be obtained in this country, and even the exception just
mentioned appears to rest rather on reasoning and principle than
on the authority of any decided case. This principle received
the highest sanction in the prosecution of Earl Russell for bigamy
before the House of Lords (1901), in which it was held that,
where a divorce had been refused him in England, an American
divorce would not relieve a man from the guilt of marrying again.</p>

<p><i>Summary Proceedings for Separation.</i>&mdash;The legislature has
sought to extend the relief afforded by the courts in matrimonial
causes by a procedure fairly to be considered within the reach of
all classes. In 1895 an act was passed which re-enacted in an
improved form the provisions of an act of 1878 of similar effect.
By the act of 1895 power was given to a married woman whose
husband (1) has been guilty of an aggravated assault upon her
within the Offences against the Person Act 1861, or (2) convicted
on indictment of an assault on her and sentenced to pay a fine
of more than Â£5 or to imprisonment for more than two months,
or (3) shall have deserted her, or (4) been guilty of persistent
cruelty to her or wilful neglect to maintain her or her infant
children, and by such cruelty or neglect shall have caused her
to leave and live apart from him, to apply to a court of summary
jurisdiction and to obtain an order containing all or any of the
following provisions:&mdash;(1) that the applicant be not forced to
cohabit with her husband, (2) that the applicant have the custody
of any children under sixteen years of age, (3) that the husband
pay to her an allowance not exceeding Â£2 a week. The act provides
that no married woman guilty of adultery should be granted
relief, but with the very important proviso, altering as it does the
rule of the common law, that the husband has not conduced
or connived at, or by wilful neglect or misconduct conduced to,
such adultery. The provisions of this act<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a> have been largely
put in force, and no doubt to the great advantage of the poorer
classes of the community. It will be observed that the act is
unilateral, and affords no relief to a husband against a wife;
and the complaint is often heard that no misconduct of the wife,
except adultery, relieves the husband from the necessity of
maintaining her and allowing her to share his home, unless he
can obtain access to the high court.<a name="fa3k" id="fa3k" href="#ft3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p><i>Separation Deeds.</i>&mdash;Although nothing in the development of
the law of divorce has tended to give to married persons the right
absolutely to dissolve their marriage by consent, and, on the
contrary, any such agreement would be held to be strong evidence
of collusion, the view of the Church expressed in the ecclesiastical
law has been entirely departed from as regards agreements for
separation. Such agreements were embodied in deeds, and
usually contained mutual covenants not to sue in the ecclesiastical
courts for restitution of conjugal rights. The ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
courts, however, wholly disregarded such agreements, and
considered them as affording no answer to a suit for restitution
of conjugal rights. For a considerable period the court of
chancery refused to enforce the covenant in such deeds by restraining
the parties from proceeding to the ecclesiastical courts.
But at last a memorable judgment of Lord Westbury (1861)
asserted the right (<i>Hunt</i> v. <i>Hunt</i>, 4 De G. F. &amp; J. 221; see also
<i>Marshall</i> v. <i>Marshall</i>, 5 P. D. 19) of the court of chancery to
maintain the claim of good faith in this as in other cases, and
restrained a petitioner from suing in the ecclesiastical court contrary
to his covenant. Thereafter these deeds became common,
and no doubt often afford a solution of matrimonial difficulties
of very great value. When the courts of the country became
united under the Judicature Acts, it became practicable to set
up in the divorce division a separation deed in answer to a
suit for restitution of conjugal rights without the necessity of
recourse to any other tribunal.</p>

<p><i>Statistics.</i>&mdash;The statistics of divorce in England have for some
years been regularly published in the volumes of judicial statistics
published annually by the Home Office.</p>

<p class="noind">It is probably impossible to account for the variations which the
above table discloses. It was no doubt natural that the year immediately
succeeding the passing of the act which originated facilities
for divorces <i>a vinculo</i> should exhibit a larger number of divorces than
its successors for a considerable period. But there does not appear
to be any adequate cause for the comparative increase which seems
to have prevailed in the decade between 1878 and 1888, unless it be
found in the increase of marriages which culminated in 1873 and
1883, falling after each of those years. The number of marriages
again rose high in 1891 and 1892, and this may account for the
increased number of divorces in 1896 and the following years. But
it may certainly be said with confidence that as compared with the
growth of population the number of divorces in England has shown
no alarming increase.</p>

<p>The total number of petitions in matrimonial causes presented by
husbands exceed those presented by wives, but in no marked degree.
This excess would seem to be due to the fact that the larger number
of petitions for dissolution presented by husbands, owing no doubt
to the difference in the law affecting the two sexes, is not entirely
counterbalanced by the much larger number of petitions for judicial
separation presented by wives. The following figures for various
years may be taken as typical:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">Speaking generally, it may be said that about 70% of the petitions
presented are successful and result in decrees. This percentage has
a tendency, however, to rise.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to ascertain the classes which supply
the petitioners for divorce, but this cannot be done with such
certainty as to warrant any but the most general conclusions. It
may, however, safely be said that while all classes, professions and
occupations are represented, it is certainly not those highest in the
scale that are the largest contributors. The principles of the act of
1857 have beyond question been justified by the relief required by
and afforded to the general community.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">Other European Countries</p>

<p>We may now turn to the law of divorce as administered in the
other countries of the modern world. On the main question
whether marriage is to be considered indissoluble they will be
found to range themselves on one side or the other according to
the influence upon them of the Church of Rome and its canon
law.</p>

<p>In <i>Scotland</i> it has long been the law that marriage can be dissolved
at the instance of either party by judicial sentence on the
grounds of adultery or of desertion, termed non-adherence, and
the spouses could in such case remarry, except with the paramour,&mdash;at
all events if the paramour was named in the decree (and the
name is sometimes omitted for that reason). A divorce <i>a mensa
et thoro</i> could also be granted for cruelty. By the Court of Session
Act 1830, the jurisdiction in divorce was transferred from a body
of commissaries to the court of session.</p>

<p>By the law of <i>Holland</i> complete divorce could be granted
by judicial sentence on the grounds of adultery or of wilful and
malicious desertion, to which were added unnatural offences and
imprisonment for life, and such divorce gave the power of remarriage,
except with the person with whom adultery was proved
to have been committed, but there would seem to be a doubt
whether this power extended to the guilty party (Voet, <i>De
divortiis</i>, lit. 24, tit. 2). Divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> could be granted
on the grounds allowed by the canon law.</p>

<p>The Code of <i>Prussia</i> of 1794 contained elaborate provisions
which gave great facility of divorce. A complete divorce could
be obtained by judicial sentence for the following causes:&mdash;(1)
Adultery or unnatural offences; and adultery by a husband
formed no bar to his obtaining a divorce against his wife for
adultery; and even an illicit intimacy, from which a presumption
of adultery might arise, was held sufficient for a divorce. (2) Wilful
desertion. (3) Obstinate refusal of the rights of marriage,
which was considered as equivalent to desertion. (4) Incapacity
to perform the duties of marriage, even if arising subsequent to
the marriage; and the same effect was assigned to other incurable
bodily defects that excited disgust and horror. (5) Lunacy,
if after a year there was no reasonable hope of recovery. (6)
An attempt on the life of one spouse by the other, or gross and
unlawful attack on the honour or personal liberty. (7) Incompatibility
of temper and quarrelsome disposition, if rising to the
height of endangering life or health. (8) Opprobrious crime for
which either spouse has suffered imprisonment, or a knowingly
false accusation of such crime by one spouse of the other. (9) If
either spouse by unlawful transactions endangers the life, honour,
office or trade of the other, or commences an ignominious employment.
(10) Change of religion. In addition to these causes,
marriages, when there were no children, could be dissolved by
mutual consent if there be no reason to suspect levity, precipitation
or compulsion; and a judge had also power to dissolve a
marriage in cases in which a strongly rooted dislike appeared to
him to exist. In all cases of divorce, but sometimes subject to
the necessity of obtaining a licence, remarriage was permissible
(see Burge, <i>Commentaries on Colonial and Foreign Law</i>, vol. i.
649).</p>

<p>Before 1876 only a divorce <i>a vinculo</i> could be obtained in
some of the German states, especially if the petitioner were a
Roman Catholic. The only relief afforded was a &ldquo;perpetual
separation.&rdquo; By the Personal Status Act 1875 perpetual separation
orders were abolished and divorce decrees allowed in cases
where the petitioners would, under the former law, have been
entitled to a perpetual separation order. However, two Drafting
Commissions under the act declined to alter the new rule, but
under pressure from the Roman Catholic party the Reichstag
passed a law introducing a modified separation order, termed
&ldquo;dissolution of the conjugal community&rdquo; (<i>Aufhebung der
ehelichen Gemeinschaft</i>). This order can be converted into a
dissolution of the marriage at the option of either party. Under
the Civil Code of 1900 a petitioner can obtain a divorce or judicial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
separation on &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; or &ldquo;relative&rdquo; grounds. In the
former case if the facts are established the petitioner is entitled
to the relief prayed for; in the latter case, it is left to judicial
discretion. The absolute grounds are adultery, bigamy, sodomy,
an attempt against the petitioner&rsquo;s life or wilful desertion. The
relative grounds are (a) such grave breach of marital duty or
dishonourable or immoral conduct as would disturb the marital
relation to such an extent that the marriage could not reasonably
be expected to continue; (b) insanity, continued for more than
three years during the marriage, and of so severe a nature that
intellectual community between the parties has ceased and is not
likely to be re-established. A divorced wife, if not exclusively
the guilty party, may retain her husband&rsquo;s name; but if exclusively
guilty, her former husband may compel her to resume
her maiden name.</p>

<p>By the law of <i>Denmark</i>, according to the Code of King Christian
the Fifth, complete divorce could be obtained for incest; for
leprosy, whether contracted before or after marriage; for transportation
for crime or flight from justice, after three years,
though not for crime itself; and for exile not arising from crime,
after seven years.</p>

<p>In <i>Sweden</i> complete divorce is granted by judicial sentence for
adultery, and in <i>Russia</i> for that cause and also for incompatibility
of temper (Ayliffe, Par. 49). On the other hand, in <i>Spain</i>
marriage is indissoluble, and the ecclesiastical courts have
retained their exclusive cognizance of matrimonial causes. In
<i>Italy</i> certain articles of the Civil Code deal with separation,
voluntary and judicial, but divorce is not allowed in any form.</p>

<p>In <i>France</i> the law of divorce has had a chequered history.
Before the Revolution the Roman canon law prevailed, marriage
was considered indissoluble, and only divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>,
known as <i>la sÃ©paration d&rsquo;habitation</i>, was permitted; though it
would appear that in the earliest age of the monarchy divorce <i>a
vinculo matrimonii</i> was allowed. <i>La sÃ©paration d&rsquo;habitation</i> was
granted at the instance of a wife for cruelty by her husband or
false accusation of a capital crime, or for habitual treatment with
contempt before the inmates of the house; but a wife could not
obtain a separation for adultery by her husband, although he
had his remedy in case of adultery by his wife. In every case
the sentence of a judicial tribunal, which took precautions against
collusion, was necessary. But the Revolution may be said to
have swept away marriage among the institutions which it overwhelmed,
and by the law of the 20th of September 1792 so great
facility was given for divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> as practically
to terminate the obligations of marriage. A reaction came with
the Code NapolÃ©on, yet even under that system of law divorce
remained comparatively easy. Mutual consent, expressed in
the manner and continued for a period specified by the law, was
cause for a divorce (the principle of the Roman law being adopted
on this point), but such consent could not take place unless the
husband was twenty-five years of age and the wife twenty-one,
unless they had been married for two years, nor after twenty
years of marriage, nor after the wife had completed her forty-fifth
year; and further, the approval of the parents of both parties
was required. In case of divorce by consent, the law required
that a proper agreement should be made for the maintenance
of the wife and the custody of the children. A husband could
obtain a divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> for adultery, but the wife
had no such power unless the husband had brought his mistress
to the home. Both husband and wife could claim divorce on the
ground of outrage, or grievous bodily injury, or condemnation
for an infamous crime. If the divorce was for adultery, the
erring party could not marry the partner of his or her guilt. A
divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> could be obtained on the same grounds as
a divorce <i>a vinculo</i>, but not by mutual consent; and if the divorce
<i>a mensa et thoro</i> continued in force for three years, the defendant
party could claim a divorce <i>a vinculo</i>. On the restoration of
royalty in 1816 divorce <i>a vinculo</i> was abolished, and pending suits
for divorce <i>a vinculo</i> were converted into suits for separation only.</p>

<p>Divorce in France, after the repeal of the provisions respecting
it in the Code NapolÃ©on in 1816, was re-enacted by a law of the
27th of July 1884, the provisions of which were simplified by
laws of 1886 and 1907. But a wide departure was made by these
laws from the terms of the Code NapolÃ©on. Divorce by consent
disappeared, and the following became the causes for which
divorce was allowed: (1) Adultery by either party to the
marriage at the suit of the other, without, in the case of adultery
by the husband, the aggravation of introduction of the concubine
into the home required by the Code; (2) violence (<i>excÃ¨s</i>) or
cruelty (<i>sÃ©vices</i>); (3) <i>injures graves</i>; and (4) <i>peine afflictive et
infamante</i>. <i>ExcÃ¨s</i> is defined by LociÃ© as &ldquo;a generic expression
comprising all acts tending to compromise the safety of the
person, without distinction as to their object or motive, premeditation
as well as furious anger, attempts upon life as well as
serious woundings.&rdquo; <i>SÃ©vices</i> are acts of ill-treatment less grave
in character, which, while not endangering life, render existence
in common intolerable (Kelly&rsquo;s <i>French Law of Marriage</i>, p. 122).
<i>Injures graves</i>, as to which the courts have considered themselves
entitled to exercise a wide discretion, have been defined as acts,
writings or words which reflect upon the honour or the reputation
of the party against whom they are directed. The courts have
held that retraction at the trial does not relieve the party from
the consequences of an <i>injure grave</i>, and that publicity is an aggravating
but not a necessary element. A letter from one spouse to
the other may constitute an <i>injure</i> and the courts have further
held themselves at liberty to consider letters written after
divorce proceedings have been commenced. <i>Injures graves</i> have
also been considered to include material injuries, and among
these have been classed habitual and groundless refusal of
matrimonial rights, communication of disease and refusal to
consent to a religious ceremony of marriage. Habitual but not
occasional drunkenness has also been held to fall within the
definition of an <i>injure grave</i>. <i>Peine afflictive et infamante</i> signifies
a legal punishment involving corporal confinement and moral
degradation.<a name="fa4k" id="fa4k" href="#ft4k"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>In addition to its recognition of full divorce, the French law
recognizes separation of two kinds, one <i>sÃ©paration de biens</i> and the
other <i>sÃ©paration de corps</i>. The effect of <i>sÃ©paration de biens</i> is
merely to put an end to the community of goods between the
spouses. It necessarily follows, but may be decreed independently
of <i>sÃ©paration de corps</i>. The grounds of <i>sÃ©paration de corps</i> are the
same as those for a divorce; and if a <i>sÃ©paration de corps</i> has
existed for three years, it may be turned into a divorce upon the
application of either party to the court.</p>

<p>Until 1893 a wife <i>sÃ©parÃ©e de corps</i> obtained only the capacity
attaching to a concomitant <i>sÃ©paration de biens</i>; that is to say,
she recovered the enjoyment and management of her separate
property, but could not deal with real property, nor take legal
proceedings, without the sanction of her husband or of the court.
But by a law of the 6th of February 1893 a wife <i>sÃ©parÃ©e de corps</i>
obtains &ldquo;the full exercise of her civil capacity, so that she shall
not need to resort to the authority of her husband or of the court.&rdquo;
In case of reconciliation, the wife returns to the limited capacity
of a wife <i>sÃ©parÃ©e de biens</i>, and after the prescribed notification of
such change of status it becomes binding on third persons.</p>

<p>The provisions of French law with regard to the custody of
the children of a dissolved marriage, and with regard to property,
do not differ materially from those prescribed by the English acts.
The custody of children is given to the party who has obtained
the divorce, unless the court, on the application of the family, or
the <i>ministÃ¨re public</i>, consider it better, in the interests of the
children, that custody should be given to the other party or a
third person; but in every case the right of both father and
mother to supervise the maintenance and education of the
children, and their liability to contribute to their support, are
continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span></p>

<p>The law in France as to property on a divorce has been
accurately stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Divorce in France effects a dissolution of the matrimonial rÃ©gime
of property as well as of the marriage itself. The decree appoints a
notary, who is charged with the settlement of the pecuniary interests
of the parties. By a stereotyped form of procedure the appointment
is made invariably for the purpose of liquidating <i>la communautÃ©
ayant existÃ© entre les Ã©poux</i>, irrespective of whether the rÃ©gime really
was that of community or another. In the case of aliens, therefore,
married under the rule of separate property, it is necessary carefully
to set this out in the notarial deed of liquidation, in order to defeat
the presumption which might be raised by the wording of the decree
that a community really did exist. The party against whom the
divorce has been pronounced loses the benefit of all settlements made
upon him or her by the other party, either by the marriage contract
or since the marriage. On the other hand, the party in whose favour
the divorce has been pronounced preserves the benefit of all settlements
made in his or her favour by the unsuccessful party. If no
such settlements were made, or if those made appear inadequate to
ensure the subsistence of the successful party, the court may grant
him or her permanent alimony out of the property of the other party,
not to exceed one-third of the income, and revocable in case it ceases
to be necessary&rdquo; (Kelly, p. 130).</p>
</div>

<p>On a divorce both parties are at liberty to remarry. The
husband could remarry at once; but the wife (art. 296 of the
Code) was only allowed to remarry after an interval of ten months.
By the act of 1907, this article was abolished, and the wife
allowed to remarry as soon as the judgment or decree granting
the divorce has been entered, providing 300 days have elapsed
since the first judgment was pronounced. A divorced husband
may remarry his divorced wife, but if he does so, he cannot be
again divorced, except on the ground of a sentence to a <i>peine
afflictive et infamante</i> passed on one of them since their remarriage.
There is, however, this limitation on the power of remarriage of
divorced persons, that the party to the marriage against whom
the decree has been pronounced is not allowed to marry the
person with whom his or her guilt has been established. Such
person, however, has no such rights as are recognized in him or
her according to English law, and cannot take any part in the
proceedings. But his or her name is referred to in the proceedings
only by an initial; and French law goes even further in the
avoidance of publicity, inasmuch as the publication of divorce
proceedings in the press is forbidden, under heavy penalties.</p>

<p>By a law of the 6th of February 1893 French jurisprudence,
more complete at least, and perhaps wiser, than English, dealt
with a matter previously in controversy, and decided that after a
divorce the wife shall resume her maiden name, and may not
continue to use the name of her divorced husband; nor may the
husband, for business or other purposes, continue to use the name
of his wife.</p>

<p>By the law of 1886 the special procedure in divorce previously
in force under the Code and under the law of 1884 was abolished,
and it was provided that matrimonial causes should be tried
according to the ordinary rules of procedure. The action therefore,
when brought, follows the methods of procedure common to
other civil proceedings. But there still remain certain necessary
preliminaries to an action of divorce. A petition must be
presented by a petitioner in person to the president of the court
sitting in chambers, with the object of a reconciliation being
effected. This is known as the <i>premiÃ¨re comparation</i>. If the
petitioner still determines to proceed, there follows the <i>seconde
comparation</i>, on which occasion both parties appear before the
president. If the president fails to effect a reconciliation, he
makes an order permitting the petitioner to proceed, and deals
with the matters necessary to be dealt with <i>pendente lite</i>, such
matters being (1) separate residence, (2) alimony, (3) possession of
personal effects, (4) custody of children. As regards residence,
the wife is compelled to adhere during the proceedings to the
residence assigned to her, but no similar restriction is placed
on the husband. Alimony <i>pendente lite</i> is in the discretion of
the court, having regard to the means of the parties, and
includes a proper provision for costs. As regards the custody of
children, the Code and the law of 1884 gave it to the husband,
unless the court otherwise orders, but the law of 1886 leaves
the matter wholly in the discretion of the court.</p>

<p>There are certain technical rules of evidence on the trial of
a divorce action. It is a general principle of the French law of
evidence that documentary evidence is the best evidence, and oral
testimony only secondary. In divorce cases adultery <i>flagrante
delicto</i> can be proved by the official certificate of the commissary
of police. Letters between the husband and wife are admissible
in evidence. As to letters between the parties and third persons,
the law, which has been doubtful, now appears to be that the wife
may produce only such letters from third parties to her husband
as have come into her possession accidentally, and without any
ruse or artifice on her part; but the husband may put in evidence
any letters written to or by his wife which he has obtained by any,
short of criminal, means. If the documents put in evidence are
not sufficient to satisfy the court, there follows an investigation
by means of witnesses, termed an <i>enquÃªte</i>. A schedule of allegations
is drawn up, and a judge, termed a <i>juge-commissaire</i>, is
specially appointed to conduct the inquiry. Relatives and servants,
though not competent witnesses in ordinary civil actions,
are so in divorce proceedings. Cross petitions may be entered;
the substantiation of a cross petition, however, does not have the
effect, in some cases given to it by English law, of barring a
divorce, but a divorce may be, and often is, granted in favour
of and against both parties <i>pour torts rÃ©ciproques</i>. When a case
comes on for trial, it is in the power of the court to order an
adjournment for a period not exceeding six months, which is termed
a <i>temps d&rsquo;Ã©preuve</i>, in order to afford an opportunity for reconciliation.
It is said, however, that this power is seldom exercised.
An appeal may be brought against a decree of divorce within two
months; and a decree made on appeal is subject to revision by
the court of cassation within two months. Both references to
the court of appeal and the court of cassation operate as a stay of
execution. A decree must, by the law of 1886, be transcribed on
the register of marriages within two months from its date, and
failing this transcription, the decree is void. The transcription
must be made at the place of celebration of the marriage, or, if the
parties are married abroad, at the place where the parties were
last domiciled in France. If the parties, after having married
abroad, return to France, it has been provided, by a circular of
the <i>Procureur de la RÃ©publique</i> in 1887, that the transcription may
be made at the place of their actual domicile at the time of action
brought, a rule which has been held to apply to the divorce of
aliens in France. The effect of transcription does not relate back
to the date of the decree.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Opinions may differ as to the relative merits of the English and
French law relating to divorce. But it cannot be denied that the
French law presents a singularly complete and well-considered
system, and one which, obviously with the English system in view, has
endeavoured to graft on it provisions supplementing its omissions,
and modifying certain of its terms in accordance with the light
afforded by experience and the changed feelings of the modern world.
The effect of the laws of 1884 and 1886 in France has been great. The
act of 1907 dealing with divorce, coupled with that of the 21st of July
of the same year dealing with marriage, may also be said to mark an
epoch in the laws relating to women. During the five years from
1884 to 1888 the courts granted divorces in 21,064 cases, rejecting
applications for divorce in 1524. In addition, there were 12,242
applications for judicial separation, of which 10,739 were granted.
A distinguished French writer, the author of a work of singular
completeness and accuracy on the judicial system of Great Britain
has compared these figures with the corresponding result of the
English act of 1857. His conclusion is expressed in these words:
&ldquo;On voit qu&rsquo;en cinq annÃ©es nos tribunaux out prononcÃ© trois fois
plus de divorces que la haute cour d&rsquo;Angleterre n&rsquo;en a prononcÃ© en
trente ans. Je n&rsquo;insiste pas sur les conclusions morales Ã  tirer de ce
rapprochement&rdquo; (Comte de Franqueville, <i>Le SystÃ¨me judiciaire de
la Grande-Bretagne</i>, ii. p. 171). It is, however, practically impossible
to compare the number of divorces in France and in England with
exact justice, because, as will have been seen above, the causes of
divorce in France materially exceed those recognized by English
law; and the absence in France of any official performing the
functions assigned to the king&rsquo;s proctor in England cannot but have
great influence on the number of applications for divorce, as well as
on their results.</p>

<div class="author">(St H.)</div>

<p class="center pt2 sc">United States</p>

<p>According to American practice, divorce is the termination
by proper legal authority, sometimes legislatively but usually
judicially, of a marriage which up to the time of the decree
was legal and binding. It is to be distinguished from a decree of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
nullity of marriage, which is simply a legal determination that
no legal marriage has ever existed between the two parties. It is
also to be distinguished from a decree of separation, which permits
or commands the parties to live apart, but does not completely
and for all purposes sever the marriage tie. The matrimonial law
of England, as at the time of the declaration of independence,
forms part of the common law of the United States. But as no
ecclesiastical courts have ever existed there, the law must be
considered to have been inoperative. There is no Federal
jurisdiction in divorce, and it is a question for the law of each
separate state; and though it is competent to Congress to
authorize divorces in the Territories, still it appears that this
subject like others is usually left to the territorial legislature. In
the different states, and in England, divorces were at first granted
by the legislatures, whether directly or by granting special
authority to the tribunals to deal with particular cases. This
practice fell into general disrepute, and by the constitution of
some states such divorces are expressly prohibited.</p>

<p>Upon the subject of divorce in the United States, and, to some
extent, in foreign countries, a careful investigation was made by
the American Bureau of Labour, and its report covered the years
1867 to 1886; a further report for the period 1887 to 1906 has
also been published by the Federal Census Bureau. The number
of divorces was in 1886 over 25,000, and in 1906 was over 72,000,
about double the number reported for that year from all the
rest of the Christian world. As divorce presupposes a legal
marriage, the amount of divorce, or the divorce-rate, is best stated
as the ratio between the number of divorces decreed during a year
and the number of subsisting marriages or married couples. The
usual basis is 100,000 married couples. In 1898-1902 the divorce-rate
was 200 divorces (400 people) to 100,000 married couples.
This is equivalent to more than one divorce annually to each 1400
people. The several states differ in divorce-rate, from South
Carolina, with no provision for legal divorce, to Montana and
Washington, where the rate is two and a half times the average for
the country. In general the rate is about the same in the North
as in the South, but greater in the Central states than in the East,
and in the Western than in the Central states; but to this rule
the New England states, Louisiana, New Mexico and Arizona
are exceptions. The New England states have a higher rate than
their geographical position would lead one to expect, and the
other three, owing doubtless, in part at least, to the influence of
the Roman Catholic Church, have a lower rate than the states
about them. The several state groups had in 1900 the following
divorce-rates per 100,000: South Atlantic, 196; North Atlantic,
200; South Central, 558; North Central, 510; Western, 712.
The divorce-rate in the United States increased rapidly and
steadily in forty years from 27 in 1867 to 86 in 1906. But distinct
tendencies are traceable in different regions. In the North Atlantic
group the rate rose by 58%, in the North Central by 158%, in the
Western by 223%, in the South Atlantic by 437%, and in the South
Central by 685%. The great increase in the South was mainly
due to the spread of divorce among the emancipated negroes.
Each state determines for itself the causes for which divorce may
be granted, and no general statement is therefore possible.</p>

<p>The ground pleaded for a divorce is seldom an index to the
motives which caused the suit to be brought. This is determined
by the character of the law rather than by the state of mind of the
parties; and so far as the individuals are concerned, the ground
alleged is thus a cloak rather than a clue or revelation. Still
those causes which have been enacted into law by the various
state legislatures do indicate the pleas which have been endorsed
by the social judgment of the respective communities. In the
United States exclusive of Alaska and the recent insular accessions
there are forty-nine different jurisdictions in the matter of divorce.
Six out of every seven allow divorce for desertion, adultery or
cruelty; and of the 945,625 divorces reported with their causes
during the twenty years 1887-1906 nearly 78% were granted for
some one of these three causes, viz. 39% for desertion, 22% for
adultery, and 16% for cruelty. Probably nearly 9% more were
for some combination of these causes. Three other grounds for
divorce are admitted as legal in many or most American states, viz.
imprisonment in 39, habitual drunkenness in 38, and neglect to
provide in 22. About 98% of American divorces are granted on
some one or more of these six grounds. In general the legislation
on the subject of the causes allowed for divorce is most restrictive
in the states on the Atlantic coast, from New York to South Carolina
inclusive, and is least so in the Western states. The slight
expense of obtaining a divorce in many of the states, and the lack
of publicity which is given to the suit, are also important reasons
for the great number of decrees issued. The importance of the
former consideration is reflected in the fact that the divorce-rate
for the United States as a whole shows clearly, in its fluctuations,
the influences of good and bad times. When times are good
and the income of the working and industrial classes likely to be
assured, the divorce-rate rises. In periods of industrial depression
it falls, fluctuating thus in the same way and probably for the
same reason that the marriage-rate in industrial communities
fluctuates. In two-thirds of the divorce suits the wife is the
plaintiff, and the proportion slightly increased in the forty years.
In the Northern states the percentage issued to wives (1887-1906)
was 71, while in the Southern states it was only 56. But where
both parties desire a decree, and each has a legal ground to urge,
a jury will usually listen more favourably to a woman&rsquo;s suit.</p>

<p>Divorce is probably especially frequent among the native
population of the United States, and among these probably more
common in the city than in the country. This statement cannot
be established absolutely, since statistics afford no means of
distinguishing the native from the foreign-born applicants. It is,
however, the most obvious reason for explaining the fact that,
while in Europe the city divorce-rate is from three to five times
as great as that of the surrounding country, the difference in the
United States between the two regions is very much less. In
other words, the great number of foreigners in American cities
probably tends to obscure by a low divorce-rate the high rate of
the native population. Divorce is certainly more common in the
New England states than in any others on the Atlantic coast
north of Florida, and it is not unlikely that wherever the New
England families have gone divorce is more frequent than elsewhere.
For example, it is much more common in the northern
counties of Ohio settled largely from New England than in the
southern counties settled largely from the Middle Atlantic states.</p>

<p>There are two statements frequently made regarding divorce in
the United States which do not find warrant in the statistics on
the subject. The first is, that the real motive for divorce with
one or both parties is the desire for marriage to a third person.
The second is, that a very large proportion of divorces are granted
to persons who move from one jurisdiction to another in order
to avail themselves of lax divorce laws. On the first point the
American statistics are practically silent, since, in issuing a
marriage licence to parties one or both of whom have been
previously divorced, no record is generally made of the fact. In
Connecticut, however, for a number of years this information was
required; and, if the statements were trustworthy, the number
of persons remarrying each year was about one-third the total
number of persons divorcing, which is probably a rate not widely
different from that of widows and widowers of the same age.
Foreign figures for Switzerland, Holland and Berlin indicate that
in those regions the proportion of the divorced who remarry
speedily is about the same as that of widows and widowers.
What statistical evidence there is on the subject therefore tends
to discredit this popular opinion. The evidence on the second
point is more conclusive, and has gone far towards decreasing
the demand for a constitutional amendment allowing a federal
marriage and divorce law. About four-fifths of all the divorces
granted in the United States were issued to parties who were
married in the state in which the decree of divorce was later
made; and when from the remaining one-fifth are deducted those
in which the parties migrated for other reasons than a desire to
obtain an easy divorce, the remainder would constitute a very
small, almost a negligible, fraction of the total number.</p>

<p>It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to say how far the frequency of
divorce in the United States has been or is a social injury; how far
it has weakened or undermined the ideal of marriage as a lifelong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
union between man and woman. In this respect the question
is very like that of illegitimacy; and as the most careful students
of the latter subject agree that almost no trustworthy inference
regarding the moral condition of a community can be derived
from the proportion of illegitimate children born, so one may say
regarding the prevalence of divorce that from this fact almost no
inferences are warranted regarding the moral or social condition
of the population. It is by no means impossible, for example,
that the spread of divorce among the negro population in the
South marks a step in advance from the condition of largely
unregulated and illegal unions characteristic of the race immediately
after the war. The prevalence of divorce in the United
States among the native population, in urban communities,
among the New England element, in the middle classes of society,
and among those of the Protestant faith, indicates how closely
this social phenomenon is interlaced with much that is characteristic
and valuable in American civilization. In this respect, too,
the United States perhaps represent the outcome of a tendency
which has been at work in Europe at least since the Reformation.
Certainly the divorce-rate is increasing in nearly every civilized
country. Decrees of nullity of marriage and decrees of separation
not absolutely terminating the marriage relation are relatively
far less prevalent than they were in the medieval and early
modern period, and many persons who under former conditions
would have obtained relief from unsatisfactory unions through
one or the other of these avenues now resort to divorce. The
increasing proportion of the community who have an income
sufficient to pay the requisite legal fees is also a factor of great
importance. The belief in the family as an institution ordained
of God, decreed to continue &ldquo;till death us do part,&rdquo; and in its
relations typifying and perpetuating many holy religious ideas,
probably became weakened in the United States during the 19th
century, along with a weakening of other religious conceptions;
and it is yet to be determined whether a substitute for these ideas
can be developed under the guidance of the motive of social
utility or individual desire. In this respect the United States is,
as Mr Gladstone once wrote, a <i>tribus praerogativa</i>, but one who
knows anything of the family and home life of America will not
readily despond of the outcome.</p>

parties were guilty of misconduct, it was held by Sir Francis Jeune
(Lord St Helier) that where a wife has by her misconduct broken
up the home (the husband&rsquo;s misconduct not having conduced to the
wife&rsquo;s adultery) the court would exercise its discretion in favour of
the husband petitioner, and, further, the wife being a rich woman,
it was justifiable to give her husband a portion of her income, in
order to preserve to him the position he would have occupied as her
husband, the broad principle being that a guilty respondent should
not be allowed to profit by divorce. But further litigation concerning
this case occurred as to the variation of the marriage settlements
in favour of the husband, and the decision of the court of appeal in
July 1905 considerably modified the decision of Sir Francis Jeune.&mdash;Ed. <i>E. B.</i></p>

her husband and has obtained a separation order within two years from
the time when the desertion commenced, she loses her right to plead
desertion under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, and is therefore
not entitled to a divorce after two years&rsquo; desertion, upon proof of
adultery. See also <i>Dodd</i> v. <i>Dodd</i>, 1906, 22 T. L. R. 484.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIX, DOROTHEA LYNDE<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (1802-1887), American philanthropist,
was born at Hampden, Maine, on the 4th of April 1802.
Her parents were poor and shiftless, and at an early age she was
taken into the home in Boston of her grandmother, Dorothea
Lynde, wife of Dr Elijah Dix. Here she was reared in a distinctly
Puritanical atmosphere. About 1821 she opened a school
in Boston, which was patronized by the well-to-do families;
and soon afterwards she also began teaching poor and neglected
children at home. But her health broke down, and from 1824
to 1830 she was chiefly occupied with the writing of books of
devotion and stories for children. Her <i>Conversations on Common
Things</i> (1824) had reached its sixtieth edition by 1869. In 1831
she established in Boston a model school for girls, and conducted
this successfully until 1836, when her health again failed. In
1841 she became interested in the condition of gaols and almshouses,
and spent two years in visiting every such institution
in Massachusetts, investigating especially the treatment of the
pauper insane. Her memorial to the state legislature dealing
with the abuses she discovered resulted in more adequate
provision being made for the care and treatment of the insane,
and she then extended her work into many other states. By 1847
she had travelled from Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico, and
had visited 18 state penitentiaries, 300 county gaols and houses
of correction, and over 500 almshouses. Her labours resulted
in the establishment of insane asylums in twenty states and in
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and in the founding of many
additional gaols and almshouses conducted on a reformed plan.
In 1853 she secured more adequate equipment for the life-saving
service on Sable Island, then rightly called &ldquo;the graveyard of
ships.&rdquo; In 1854 she secured the passage by Congress of a bill
granting to the states 12,250,000 acres of public lands, to be
utilized for the benefit of the insane, deaf, dumb and blind;
but the measure was vetoed by President Pierce. After this disappointment
she went to England for rest, but at once became
interested in the condition of the insane in Scotland, and her
report to the home secretary opened the way for sweeping
reforms. She extended her work into the Channel Islands, and
then to France, Italy, Austria, Greece, Turkey, Russia, Sweden,
Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium and a part of Germany.
Her influence over Arinori Mori, the Japanese <i>chargÃ© d&rsquo;affaires</i> at
Washington, led eventually to the establishment of two asylums
for the insane in Japan. At the outbreak of the Civil War she
offered her services to the Federal government and was appointed
superintendent of women nurses. In this capacity she served
throughout the war, without a day&rsquo;s furlough; and her labours
on behalf of defectives were continued after the war. After a
lingering illness of six years she died at Trenton, New Jersey, on
the 17th of July 1887.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIX, JOHN ADAMS<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (1798-1879), American soldier and
political leader, was born at Boscawen, New Hampshire, on the
24th of July 1798. He studied at Phillips Exeter Academy in
1810-1811 and at the College of Montreal in 1811-1812, and as
a boy took part in the War of 1812, becoming a second lieutenant
in March 1814. In July 1828, having attained the rank of captain,
he resigned from the army, and for two years practised law
at Cooperstown, New York. In 1830-1833 he was adjutant-general
of New York. He soon became prominent as one of the
leaders of the Democratic party in the state, and for many years
was a member of the so-called &ldquo;Albany Regency,&rdquo; a group of
Democrats who between about 1820 and 1850 exercised a
virtual control over their party in New York, dictating nominations
and appointments and distributing patronage. From 1833
to 1839 he was secretary of state and superintendent of schools
in New York, and in this capacity made valuable reports concerning
the public schools of the state, and a report (1836) which
led to the publication of the <i>Natural History of the State of New
York</i> (1842-1866). In 1842 he was a member of the New York
assembly. In 1841-1843 he was editor of <i>The Northern Light</i>, a
literary and scientific journal published in Albany. From 1845
to 1849 he was a United States senator from New York; and
as chairman of the committee on commerce was author of the
warehouse bill passed by Congress in 1846 to relieve merchants
from immediate payment of duties on imported goods. In 1848
he was nominated for governor of New York by the Free Soil
party, but was defeated by Hamilton Fish. His acceptance of
the nomination, however, earned him the enmity of the southern
Democrats, who prevented his appointment by Pierce as secretary
of state and as minister to France in 1853. In this year Dix was
for a few weeks assistant U.S. treasurer in New York city. In
May 1860 he became postmaster of New York city, and from
January until March 1861 he was secretary of the treasury of the
United States, in which capacity he issued (January 29, 1861) to
a revenue officer at New Orleans a famous order containing the
words, &ldquo;if any one attempts to haul down the American flag,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>347</span>
shoot him on the spot.&rdquo; He rendered important services in
hurrying forward troops in 1861, was appointed major-general
of volunteers in June 1861, and during the Civil War commanded
successively the department of Maryland (July 1861-May 1862),
Fortress Monroe (May 1862-July 1863), and the department of
the East (July 1863-July 1865). He was minister to France
from 1866 to 1869, and in 1872 was elected by the Republicans
governor of New York, but was defeated two years later. He had
great energy and administrative ability, was for a time president
of the Chicago &amp; Rock Island and of the Mississippi &amp; Missouri
railways, first president of the Union Pacific in 1863-1868, and
for a short time in 1872 president of the Erie. He died in New
York city on the 21st of April 1879. Among his publications are
<i>A Winter in Madeira and a Summer in Spain and Florence</i> (1850),
and <i>Speeches and Occasional Addresses</i> (1864). He wrote excellent
English versions of the <i>Dies irae</i> and the <i>Stabat mater</i>.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Morgan Dix</span> (1827-1908), graduated at Columbia in
1848 and at the General Theological Seminary in 1852, and was
ordained deacon (1852) and priest (1853) in the Protestant
Episcopalian church. In 1855-1859 he was assistant minister,
and in 1859-1862 assistant rector, of Trinity Church, New York
city, of which he was rector from 1862 until his death. He
published sermons and lectures; <i>A History of the Parish of
Trinity Church, New York City</i> (4 vols., 1898-1905); and a
biography of his father. <i>Memoirs of John Adams Dix</i> (2 vols.,

served under Captain Cook in his third expedition, during which
he had an opportunity of learning the commercial capabilities
of the north-west coast of North America. After his return from
Cook&rsquo;s expedition he became a captain in the royal navy. In the
autumn of 1785 he sailed in the &ldquo;Queen Charlotte,&rdquo; in the service
of the King George&rsquo;s Sound Company of London, to explore the
shores of the present British Columbia, with the special object of
developing the fur trade. His chief discoveries were those of
Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s Islands and Sound (the latter only partial),
Port Mulgrave, Norfolk Bay, and Dixon&rsquo;s Entrance and Archipelago.
After visiting China, where he disposed of his cargo,
he returned to England (1788), and published (1799) <i>A Voyage
round the World, but more particularly to the North-West Coast of
America</i>, the bulk of which consists of descriptive letters by
William Beresford, his supercargo. His own contribution to the
work included valuable charts and appendices. He is usually,

to the bar in 1853, soon returned to sporting journalism, in which
he had already made a name for himself, and began to write
regularly for the <i>Sporting Magazine</i>, in the pages of which
appeared three of his novels, <i>Post and Paddock</i> (1856), <i>Silk and
Scarlet</i> (1859), and <i>Scott and Sebright</i> (1862). He also published
a legal compendium entitled <i>The Law of the Farm</i> (1858), which
ran through several editions. His other more important works
were <i>Field and Fern</i> (1865), giving an account of the herds and
flocks of Scotland, and <i>Saddle and Sirloin</i> (1870), treating in the
same manner those of England. He died at Kensington on the
16th of March 1870.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIXON, RICHARD WATSON<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (1833-1900), English poet and
divine, son of Dr James Dixon, a Wesleyan minister, was born
on the 5th of May 1833. He was educated at King Edward&rsquo;s
school, Birmingham, and on proceeding to Pembroke College,
Oxford, became one of the famous &ldquo;Birmingham group&rdquo; there
who shared with William Morris and Burne-Jones in the Pre-Raphaelite
movement. He took only a second class in moderations
in 1854, and a third in <i>Literae Humaniores</i> in 1856; but in
1858 he won the Arnold prize for an historical essay, and in 1863
the English Sacred Poem prize. He was ordained in 1858, was
second master of Carlisle high school, 1863-1868, and successively
vicar of Hayton, Cumberland, and Warkworth, Northumberland.
He became minor canon and honorary librarian of Carlisle in
1868, and honorary canon in 1874, he was proctor in convocation
(1890-1894), and received the honorary degree of D.D. from
Oxford in 1899. He died at Warkworth on the 23rd of January
1900. Canon Dixon&rsquo;s first two volumes of verse, <i>Christ&rsquo;s
Company</i> and <i>Historical Odes</i>, were published in 1861 and 1863
respectively; but it was not until 1883 that he attracted
conspicuous notice with <i>Mano</i>, an historical poem in <i>terza
rima</i>, which was enthusiastically praised by Mr Swinburne. This
success he followed up by three privately printed volumes. <i>Odes
and Eclogues</i> (1884), <i>Lyrical Poems</i> (1886), and <i>The Story of
Eudocia</i> (1888). Dixon&rsquo;s poems were during the last fifteen
years of his life recognized as scholarly and refined exercises,
touched with both dignity and a certain severe beauty, but he
never attained any general popularity as a poet, the appeal of
his poetry being directly to the scholar. A great student of
history, his studies in that direction colour much of his poetry.
The romantic atmosphere is remarkably preserved in <i>Mano</i>, a
successful metrical exercise in the difficult <i>terza rima</i>. His typical
poems have charm and melody, without introducing any new
note or variety of rhythm. He is contemplative, sober and
finished in literary workmanship, a typical example of the Oxford
school. Pleasant as his poetry is, however, he will probably be
longest remembered by the work to which he gave the best years
of his life, his <i>History of the Church of England from the Abolition
of the Roman Jurisdiction</i> (1878-1902). At the time of his death
he had completed six volumes, two of which were published
posthumously. This fine work, covering the period from 1529 to
1570, is built upon elaborate research, and presents a trustworthy
and unprejudiced survey of its subject.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIXON, WILLIAM HEPWORTH<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (1821-1879), English author
and traveller, was born at Great Ancoats, Manchester, on the
30th of June 1821, a member of an old Lancashire family.
Beginning life as a clerk at Manchester, he decided, in 1846, to
take up literature as a career. After gaining some journalistic
experience at Cheltenham he settled in London, on the recommendation
of Douglas Jerrold, and contributed to the <i>Athenaeum</i>
and <i>Daily News</i>. His series of papers&mdash;&ldquo;The Literature of the
Lower Orders&rdquo;&mdash;in the last-named journal, and a further series,
&ldquo;London Prisons,&rdquo; were widely noticed. In 1849 appeared his
<i>John Howard and the Prison World of Europe</i>, which proved a
great popular success. These were followed by a <i>Life of William
Penn</i> (1851), in which he replied to Macaulay&rsquo;s attack on Penn;
<i>Life of Blake</i> (1852); and <i>Personal History of Lord Bacon</i> (1861),
supplemented by <i>The Story of Lord Bacon&rsquo;s Life</i> (1862). From
1853 to 1869 he was editor of the <i>Athenaeum</i>. In 1863 he visited
the East, and on his return helped to found the Palestine

(1890) 5161; (1900) 7917 (879 foreign-born); (1910) 7216. It
is served by the Chicago &amp; North-Western and the Illinois
Central railways, and is connected with Sterling by an electric
line; freight is shipped over the Hennepin Canal. The city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
has two parks of 159 and 6 acres respectively, and there is a
Chautauqua Park, where an annual Chautauqua Assembly is
held. Dixon is the seat of the Northern Illinois normal school
(incorporated in 1884), and of the Rock River military academy.
The river furnishes water power for the street railways, electric
lighting and a number of manufacturing establishments.
Among the manufactures are condensed milk, boxes, wire screens
and wire cloth, lawn mowers, gas engines, cement, agricultural
implements, shoes and wagons. The place was laid out in
1835 by John Dixon (1784-1876), the first white settler of Lee
county. A bronze tablet in the Howells Building, at the intersection
of First and Peoria Streets, marks the site of his cabin,
and in the city cemetery a granite shaft has been erected to his
memory. Dixon was chartered as a city in 1859.</p>

a vast basilica built of brick and white stone, with a central dome
and two lofty spires above the north entrance, was founded in
1866 and consecrated in 1882. Its style is Romanesque, chosen
by Strossmayer as symbolical of the position of his country
midway between east and west. The interior is magnificently
decorated with mosaics, mural paintings and statuary, chiefly
the work of local artists. Other noteworthy buildings are the
nunnery, ecclesiastical seminary and episcopal palace. Djakovo
has a thriving trade in agricultural produce. Many Roman
remains have been discovered in the neighbourhood, but the

<p><span class="bold">DLUGOSZ, JAN<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Johannes Longinus</span>] (1415-1480), Polish
statesman and historian, was the son of Jan Dlugosz, burgrave
of Bozeznica. Born in 1415, he graduated at the university of
Cracow and in 1431 entered the service of Bishop Zbygniew
Olesnicki (1389-1455), the statesman and diplomatist. He
speedily won the favour of his master, who induced him to take
orders and made him his secretary. His preferment was rapid.
In 1436 we find him one of the canons of Cracow and the administrator
of Olesnicki&rsquo;s vast estates. In 1440, on returning from
Hungary, whither his master had escorted King Wladislaus II.,
Dlugosz saved the life of Olesnicki from robbers. The prelate
now employed Dlugosz on the most delicate and important
political missions. Dlugosz brought Olesnicki the red hat from
Rome in 1449, and shortly afterwards was despatched to Hungary
to mediate between Hunyadi and the Bohemian condottiere
Giszkra, a difficult mission which he most successfully accomplished.
Both these embassies were undertaken contrary to
the wishes of King Casimir IV., who was altogether opposed to
Olesnicki&rsquo;s ecclesiastical policy. But though he thus sacrificed his
own prospects to the cardinal&rsquo;s good pleasure, Dlugosz was far too
sagacious to approve of the provocative attitude of Olesnicki, and
frequently and fearlessly remonstrated with him on his conduct.
In his account, however, of the quarrel between Casimir and
Olesnicki concerning the question of priority between the cardinal
and the primate of Poland he warmly embraced the cause of the
former, and even pronounced Casimir worthy of dethronement.
Such outbursts against Casimir IV. are not infrequent in
Dlugosz&rsquo;s <i>Historia Polonica</i>, and his strong personal bias must
certainly be taken into consideration in any critical estimate of
that famous work. Yet as a high-minded patriot Dlugosz had
no sympathy whatever with Olesnicki&rsquo;s opposition to Casimir&rsquo;s
Prussian policy, and steadily supported the king during the whole
course of the war with the Teutonic knights. When Olesnicki
died in 1455 he left Dlugosz his principal executor. The office of
administering the cardinal&rsquo;s estate was a very ungrateful one, for
the family resented the liberal benefactions of their kinsman to
the Church and the <span class="correction" title="amended from univesity">university</span>, and accused Dlugosz of exercising
undue influence, from which charge he triumphantly vindicated
himself. It was in the year of his patron&rsquo;s death that he began to
write his <i>Historia Polonica</i>. This great book, the first and still
one of the best historical works on Poland in the modern sense of
the word, was only undertaken after mature consideration and
an exhaustive study of all the original sources then available,
some of which are now lost. The principal archives of Poland
and Hungary were ransacked for the purpose, and in his account of
his own times Dlugosz&rsquo;s intimate acquaintance with the leading
scholars and statesmen of his day stood him in good stead. The
style is modelled on that of Livy, of whom Dlugosz was a warm
admirer. As a proof of the thoroughness and conscientiousness of
Dlugosz it may be mentioned that he learned the Cyrillic alphabet
and took up the study of Ruthenian, &ldquo;in order that this our
history may be as plain and perfect as possible.&rdquo; The first of the
numerous imprints of the <i>Historia Polonica</i> appeared in 1614, the
first complete edition in 1711.</p>

<p>Dlugosz&rsquo;s literary labours did not interfere with his political
activity. In 1467 the generous and discerning Casimir IV.
entrusted Dlugosz with the education of his sons, the eldest of
whom, Wladislaus, at the urgent request of the king, he accompanied
to Prague when in 1471 the young prince was elected
king of Bohemia. Dlugosz refused the archbishopric of Prague
because of his strong dislike of the land of the Hussites; but seven
years later he accepted the archbishopric of Lemberg. His last
years were devoted to his history, which he completed in 1479.
He died on the 19th of May 1480, at Piatek.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DMITRIEV, IVAN IVANOVICH<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (1760-1837), Russian statesman
and poet, was born at his father&rsquo;s estate in the government of
Simbirsk. In consequence of the revolt of Pugachev the family
had to flee to St Petersburg, and there Ivan was entered at the
school of the Semenov Guards, and afterwards obtained a post
in the military service. On the accession of Paul to the imperial
throne he quitted the army with the title of colonel; and
his appointment as procurator for the senate was soon after
renounced for the position of privy councillor. During the four
years from 1810 to 1814 he served as minister of justice under the
emperor Alexander; but at the close of this period he retired into
private life, and though he lived more than twenty years, he never
again took office, but occupied himself with his literary labours
and the collection of books and works of art. In the matter of
language he sided with Karamsin, and did good service by his
own pen against the Old Slavonic party. His poems include songs,
odes, satires, tales, epistles, &amp;c., as well as the fables&mdash;partly
original and partly translated from Fontaine, Florian and Arnault&mdash;on
which his fame chiefly rests. Several of his lyrics have
become thoroughly popular from the readiness with which they
can be sung; and a short dramatico-epic poem on Yermak, the
Cossack conqueror of Siberia, is well known.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His writings occupy three volumes in the first five editions; in the

<p><span class="bold">DNIEPER,<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> one of the most important rivers of Europe (the
<i>Borysthenes</i> of the Greeks, <i>Danapris</i> of the Romans, <i>Uzi</i> or <i>Uzu</i> of
the Turks, Eksi of the Tatars, <i>Elice</i> of Visconti&rsquo;s map (1381),
<i>Lerene</i> of Contarini (1437), <i>Luosen</i> of Baptista of Genoa (1514),
and <i>Lussem</i> in the same century). It belongs entirely to Russia,
and rises in the government of Smolensk, in a swampy district
(alt. 930 ft.) at the foot of the Valdai Hills, not far from the
sources of the Volga and the Dvina, in 55Â° 52&rsquo; N. and 33Â° 41&rsquo; E.
Its length is about 1410 m. and it drains an area of 202,140 sq. m.
In the first part of its course, which may be said to end at
Dorogobuzh, it flows through an undulating country of Carboniferous
formation; in the second it passes west to Orsha, south
through the fertile plain of Chernigov and Kiev, and then south-east
across the rocky steppe of the Ukraine to Ekaterinoslav.
About 45 m. S. of this town it has to force its way across the same
granitic offshoot of the Carpathian mountains which interrupts
the course of the Dniester and the Bug, and for a distance of about
25 m. rapid succeeds rapid. The fall of the river in that distance
is 155 ft. The Dnieper, having got clear of the rocks, continues
south-west through the grassy plains of Kherson and Taurida,
and enters the Black Sea, or rather a <i>liman</i> or bay of the Black
Sea, by a considerable estuary in 46Â° 30&prime; N. and 32Â° 20&prime; E. On
this ramifying <i>liman</i>, into which the Bug also pours its waters,
stand Nikolaiev and the fortified town of Ochakov. Navigation
extends as far up as Dorogobuzh, where the depth is about 12 ft.,
and rafts are floated down from the higher reaches. The banks
are generally high, more particularly the left bank. About the
town of Smolensk the breadth is 455 ft., at the confluence of the
Pripet 1400, and in some parts of the Ekaterinoslav district more
than 1Â¼ m. In the course above the rapids the channel varies
very greatly in nature and depth, and it is not infrequently
interrupted by shallows. The rapids, or <i>porogs</i>, form a serious
obstacle to navigation; it is only for a few weeks when the river
is in flood that they are passable, and even then the venture is not
without risk and can only be undertaken with the assistance of
special pilots. It is from these falls that the Cossacks of the
Ukraine came to be known as Zaporogian Cossacks. As early
as 1732 an attempt was made to improve the channel. A canal,
which ultimately proved too small for use, was constructed at
Nenasitets in 1780 at private expense; blastings were carried out
in 1798 and 1799 at various parts; in 1805 a canal was formed at
Kaindatski, and the channel straightened at Sursk; by 1807 a
new canal was completed at Nenasitets; in 1833 a passage was
cleared through the Staro-kaindatski porog; and in the period
1843 to 1853 numerous ameliorations were effected. The result
has been not only to diminish greatly the dangers of the natural
channel, but also to furnish a series of artificial canals by which
vessels can make their way when the river is low. Of the
tributaries of the Dnieper the following are navigable,&mdash;the
Berezina and the Pripet from the right, and the Sozh and the
Desna from the left. By means of the Dnieper-Bug (King&rsquo;s)
canal, and the Berezina and Oginski canals, this river has a sort
of water connexion with the Baltic Sea. In the estuary the
fisheries give employment to large numbers of people. At Kiev
the river is free from ice on an average of 234 days in the year, at
Ekaterinoslav 270 and at Kherson 277.</p>

authors, <i>Nistrul</i> of the Rumanians, and <i>Turla</i> of the Turks), a
river of south-eastern Europe belonging to the basin of the Black
Sea. It rises on the northern slope of the Carpathian mountains
in Austrian Galicia, and belongs for the first 350 m. of its course
to Austrian, for the remaining 515 m. to Russian, territory. It
drains an area of 29,670 sq. m., of which 16,500 sq. m. belong to
Russia. It is excessively meandering, and the current in most
parts even during low water is decidedly rapid as compared with
Russian rivers generally, the mean rate being calculated at 1<span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">11</span> m.
per hour. The average width of the channel is from 500 to 750 ft.,
but in some places it attains as much as 1400 ft.; the depth is
various and changeable. The principal interruption in the
navigable portion of the river, besides a sprinkling of rocks in the
bed and the somewhat extensive shallows, is occasioned by a
granitic spur from the Carpathians, which gives rise to the Yampol
Rapids. For ordinary river craft the passage of these rapids is
rendered possible, but not free from danger, by a natural channel
on the left side, and by a larger and deeper artificial channel on
the right; for steamboats they form an insuperable barrier. The
river falls into the sea by several arms, passing through a shallow
<i>liman</i> or lagoon, a few miles S.W. of Odessa. There are two
periodical floods,&mdash;the earlier and larger caused by the breaking
up of the ice, and occurring in the latter part of February or in
March; and the later due to the melting of the snows in the
Carpathians, and taking place about June. The spring flood
raises the level of the water 20 ft., and towards the mouth of
the river submerges the gardens and vineyards of the adjacent
country. In some years the general state of the water is so low
that navigation is possible only for three or four weeks, while
in other years it is so high that navigation continues without
interruption; but in recent years considerable improvements
have been effected at government expense. In consequence
the traffic has increased, the Dniester tapping regions of great
productiveness, especially in cereals and timber, namely, Galicia,
Podolia and Bessarabia. Steamboat traffic was introduced in the
lower reaches in 1840. The fisheries of the lower course and of
the estuary are of considerable importance; and these, together
with those of the lakes which are formed by the inundations,
furnish a valuable addition to the diet of the people in the shape
of carp, pike, tench, salmon, sturgeon and eels. Its tributaries
are numerous, but not of individual importance, except perhaps
the Sereth in Galicia.</p>

at Union College, Schenectady, New York, in 1818, studied
theology and, in 1821, was ordained deacon and in 1823 priest by
Bishop Hobart, whom he assisted in Trinity church, New York.
With George Upfold (1796-1872), bishop of Indiana from 1849
to 1872, Doane founded St Luke&rsquo;s in New York City. In 1824-1828
he was professor of belles-lettres in Washington (now
Trinity) College, Hartford, Connecticut, and at this time he was
one of the editors of the <i>Episcopal Watchman</i>. He was assistant
in 1828-1830 and rector in 1830-1832 of Christ church, Boston,
and was bishop of New Jersey from October 1832 to his death at
Burlington, New Jersey, on the 27th of April 1859. The diocese
of New Jersey was an unpromising field, but he took up his work
there with characteristic vigour, especially in the foundation of
St Mary&rsquo;s Hall (1837, for girls) and Burlington College (1846) as
demonstrations of his theory of education under church control.
His business management of these schools got him heavily into
debt, and in the autumn of 1852 a charge of lax administration
came before a court of bishops, who dismissed it. The schools
showed him an able and wise disciplinarian, and his patriotic
orations and sermons prove him a speaker of great power.
He belonged to the High Church party and was a brilliant
controversialist. He published <i>Songs by the Way</i> (1824), a
volume of poems; and his hymns beginning &ldquo;Softly now the
light of day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thou art the Way&rdquo; are well known.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
Ferry is served by the Hudson River division of the New York
Central railway. There are many fine country places, two private
schools&mdash;the Mackenzie school for boys and the Misses Masters&rsquo;
school for girls&mdash;and the children&rsquo;s village (with about thirty
cottages) of the New York juvenile asylum. The name of the
village was derived from a Swede, Jeremiah Dobbs, whose family
probably moved hither from Delaware, and who at the beginning
of the last quarter of the 18th century had a skiff ferry,
which was kept up by his family for a century afterwards.
Because Dobbs Ferry had been a part of Philipse Manor all lands
in it were declared forfeit at the time of the War of American
Independence (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Yonkers</a></span>), and new titles were derived from
the commissioners of forfeitures. The position of the village
opposite the northernmost end of the Palisades gave it importance
during the war. The region was repeatedly raided by camp
followers of each army; earthworks and a fort, commanding
the Hudson ferry and the ferry to Paramus, New Jersey, were
built; the British army made Dobbs Ferry a rendezvous, after
the battle of White Plains, in November 1776, and the continental
division under General Benjamin Lincoln was here at the
end of January 1777. The American army under Washington
encamped near Dobbs Ferry on the 4th of July 1781, and started
thence for Yorktown in the following month. In the Van Brugh
Livingston house on the 6th of May 1783, Washington and
Governor George Clinton met General Sir Guy Carleton, afterwards
Lord Dorchester, to negotiate for the evacuation by the
British troops of the posts they still held in the United States.
In 1873 the village was incorporated as Greenburgh, from the
township of the same name which in 1788 had been set apart
from the manor of Phillipsburgh; but the name Dobbs Ferry
was soon resumed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DOBELL, SYDNEY THOMPSON<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> (1824-1874), English poet
and critic, was born on the 5th of April 1824 at Cranbrook, Kent.
His father was a wine merchant, his mother a daughter of Samuel
Thompson (1766-1837), a London political reformer. The
family moved to Cheltenham when Dobell was twelve years old.
He was educated privately, and never attended either school or
university. He refers to this in some lines on Cheltenham College
in imitation of Chaucer, written in his eighteenth year. After
a five years&rsquo; engagement he married, in 1844, Emily Fordham, a
lady of good family. An acquaintance with Mr (subsequently Sir
James) Stansfeld and with the Birmingham preacher-politician,
George Dawson (1821-1876), which afterwards led to the
foundation of the Society of the Friends of Italy, fed the young
enthusiast&rsquo;s ardour for the liberalism of the day. Meanwhile,
Dobell wrote a number of minor poems, instinct with a passionate
desire for political reform. <i>The Roman</i> appeared in 1850, under
the <i>nom de plume</i> of &ldquo;Sydney Yendys.&rdquo; Next year he travelled
through Switzerland with his wife; and after his return he
formed friendships with Robert Browning, Philip Bailey, George
MacDonald, Emanuel Deutsch, Lord Houghton, Ruskin, Holman
Hunt, Mazzini, Tennyson and Carlyle. His second long poem,
<i>Balder</i>, appeared in 1854. The three following years were spent
in Scotland. Perhaps his closest friend at this time was Alexander
Smith, in company with whom he published, in 1855, a number
of sonnets on the Crimean War, which were followed by a
volume on <i>England in Time of War</i>. Although by no means
a rich man he was always ready to help needy men of letters,
and it was through his exertions that David Gray&rsquo;s poems
were published. In 1869 a horse, which he was riding, fell and
rolled over with him. His health, which had for several years
necessitated his wintering abroad, was seriously affected by this
accident, and he was from this time more or less of an invalid,
until his death on the 22nd of August 1874.</p>

<p>As a poet Dobell belongs to the &ldquo;spasmodic school,&rdquo; as it was
named by Professor Aytoun, who parodied its style in <i>Firmilian</i>.
The epithet, however, was first applied by Carlyle to Byron.
The school includes George Gilfillan, Philip James Bailey, John
Stanyan Bigg (1826-1865), Dobell, Alexander Smith, and,
according to some critics, Gerald Massey. It was characterized
by an under-current of discontent with the mystery of existence,
by vain effort, unrewarded struggle, sceptical unrest, and an
uneasy straining after the unattainable. It thus faithfully
reflected a certain phase of 19th century thought. The productions
of the school are marked by an excess of metaphor
and a general extravagance of language. On the other hand,
they exhibit freshness and originality often lacking in more
conventional writings. Dobell&rsquo;s poem, <i>The Roman</i>, dedicated
to the interests of political liberty in Italy, is marked by
pathos, energy and passionate love of freedom, but it is overlaid
with monologue, which is carried to a dreary excess in
<i>Balder</i>, relieved though the latter is by fine descriptive passages,
and by some touching songs. Dobell&rsquo;s suggestive, but too
ornate prose writings were collected and edited with an introductory
note by Professor J. Nichol (<i>Thoughts on Art, Philosophy
and Religion</i>) in 1876. In his religious views Dobell was a
Christian of the Broad Church type; and socially he was one of
the most amiable and true-hearted of men. His early interest
in the cause of oppressed nationalities, shown in his friendship
with Kossuth, Emanuel Deutsch and others, never lessened,
although his views of home politics underwent some change from

the Baltic and 7 W. of Rostock by rail. Pop. 5000. Besides the
ruins of a Cistercian abbey founded by Pribislaus, prince of
Mecklenburg, in 1173, and secularized in 1552, it possesses an
Evangelical Gothic church of the 14th century, one of the finest in
north Germany, a grand-ducal palace, a theatre, an exchange and
a concert hall. Owing to its delightful situation amid beech
forests and to its chalybeate waters, Doberan has become a
favourite summer resort. Numerous villa residences have been
erected and promenades and groves laid out. In 1793 Duke
Frederick Francis caused the first seaside watering-place in
Germany to be established on the neighbouring coast, 4 m.
distant, at the spot where the Heiligen-Damm, a great bank of
rocks about 1000 ft. broad and 15 ft. high, stretches out into the
sea and forms an excellent bathing ground. Though no longer
so popular as in the early part of the 19th century, it is still
frequented, and is connected with Doberan by a tramway.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DÃ–BEREINER, JOHANN WOLFGANG<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> (1780-1849), German
chemist, was born near Hof in Bavaria on the 15th of December
1780. After studying pharmacy at MÃ¼nchberg, he started a
chemical manufactory in 1803, and in 1810 was appointed
professor of chemistry, pharmacy and technology at Jena,
where he died on the 24th of March 1849. The Royal Society&rsquo;s
<i>Catalogue</i> enumerates 171 papers by him on various chemical
topics, but his name is best known for his experiments on
platinum in a minute state of division and on the oxidation
products of alcohol. In 1822 he showed that when a mass
of platinum black, supplied with alcohol by a wick is enclosed
in a jar to which the air has limited access, acetic acid and water
are produced; this experiment formed the basis of the SchÃ¼tzenbach
Quick Vinegar Process. A year later he noticed that
spongy platinum in presence of oxygen can bring about the ignition
of hydrogen, and utilized this fact to construct his &ldquo;hydrogen
lamp,&rdquo; the prototype of numerous devices for the self-ignition of
coal-gas burners. He studied the formation of aldehyde from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>
alcohol by various methods, also obtaining its crystalline compound
with ammonia, and he was the discoverer of furfurol.
An early observation of the diffusion of gases was recorded by
him in 1823 when he noticed the escape of hydrogen from a
cracked jar, attributing it to the capillary action of fissures.
His works included treatises on pneumatic chemistry (1821-1825)
and the chemistry of fermentation (1822).</p>

<p><span class="bold">DOBREE, PETER PAUL<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> (1782-1825), English classical scholar

school under Richard Valpy and at Trinity College, Cambridge,
where he was elected fellow. He was appointed regius professor
of Greek in 1823, and died in Cambridge on the 24th of September
1825. He was an intimate friend of Porson, whom he took as his
model in textual criticism, although he showed less caution in
conjectural emendation. After Porson&rsquo;s death (1808) Dobree
was commissioned with Monk and Blomfield to edit his literary
remains, which had been bequeathed to Trinity College. Illness
and a subsequent journey to Spain delayed the work until 1820,
when Dobree brought out the <i>Plutus</i> of Aristophanes (with his
own and Porson&rsquo;s notes) and all Porson&rsquo;s <i>Aristophanica</i>. Two
years later he published the <i>Lexicon</i> of Photius from Porson&rsquo;s
transcript of the Gale MS. in Trinity College library, to which he
appended a <i>Lexicon rhetoricum</i> from the margin of a Cambridge
MS. of Harpocration. James Scholefield, his successor in the
Greek professorship, brought out selections from his notes
(<i>Adversaria</i>, 1831-1833) on Greek and Latin authors (especially
the orators), and a reprint of the <i>Lexicon rhetoricum</i>, together
with notes on inscriptions (1834-1835). The latest edition of the

<p><span class="bold">DÃ–BRENTEI, GABOR<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Gabriel</span>] (1786-1851), Hungarian
philologist and antiquary, was born at NagyszÃ¶llÃ¶s in 1786.
He completed his studies at the universities of Wittenberg and
Leipzig, and was afterwards engaged as a tutor in Transylvania.
At this period he originated and edited the <i>ErdÃ©lyi Muzeum</i>,
which, notwithstanding its important influence on the development
of the Magyar language and literature, soon failed for want
of support. In 1820 DÃ¶brentei settled at Pest, and there he spent
the rest of his life. He held various official posts, but continued
zealously to pursue the studies for which he had early shown a
strong preference. His great work is the <i>Ancient Monuments of
the Magyar Language</i> (<i>RÃ©gi Magyar NyelvemlÃ©kek</i>), the editing
of which was entrusted to him by the Hungarian Academy. The
first volume was published in 1838 and the fifth was in course
of preparation at the time of his death. DÃ¶brentei was one of
the twenty-two scholars appointed in 1825 to plan and organize,
under the presidency of Count Teleki, the Hungarian Academy.
In addition to his great work he wrote many valuable papers
on historical and philological subjects, and many biographical
notices of eminent Hungarians. These appeared in the Hungarian
translation of Brockhaus&rsquo;s <i>Conversations-Lexikon</i>. He translated
into Hungarian <i>Macbeth</i> and other plays of Shakespeare, Sterne&rsquo;s
letters from Yorick to Eliza (1828), several of Schiller&rsquo;s tragedies,
and MoliÃ¨re&rsquo;s <i>Avare</i>, and wrote several original poems. DÃ¶brentei
does not appear to have taken any part in the revolutionary
movement of 1848. He died at his country house, near Pest,
on the 28th of March 1851.</p>

Society of Jesus in 1736, and in 1749 proceeded to Paraguay,
where for eighteen years he worked devotedly first among the
Guaranis, and then among the Abipones. Returning to Europe
on the expulsion of the Jesuits from South America, he settled at
Vienna, obtained the friendship of Maria Theresa, survived the
extinction of his order, composed the history of his mission, and
died on the 17th of July 1791. The lively if rather garrulous book
on which his title to remembrance rests, appeared at Vienna in
1784, in the author&rsquo;s own Latin, and in a German translation by
Professor Krail of the university of Pest. Of its contents some idea
may be obtained from its extended title:&mdash;<i>Historia de Abiponibus,

translation sometimes ascribed to Southey, but really the
work of Sara Coleridge, who had undertaken the task to defray
the college expenses of one of her brothers. A delicate compliment

<p><span class="bold">DOBROWSKY, JOSEPH<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (1753-1829), Hungarian philologist,
was born of Bohemian parentage at Gjermet, near Raab, in
Hungary. He received his first education in the German school
at Bischofteinitz, made his first acquaintance with Bohemian
at the Deutschbrod gymnasium, studied for some time under
the Jesuits at Klattau, and then proceeded to the university of
Prague. In 1772 he was admitted among the Jesuits at BrÃ¼nn;
but on the dissolution of the order in 1773 he returned to Prague
to study theology. After holding for some time the office of tutor
in the family of Count Nostitz, he obtained an appointment first
as vice-rector, and then as rector, in the general seminary at
Hradisch; but in 1790 he lost his post through the abolition
of the seminaries throughout Austria, and returned as a guest
to the house of the count. In 1792 he was commissioned by
the Bohemian Academy of Sciences to visit Stockholm, Abo,
Petersburg and Moscow in search of the manuscripts which had
been scattered by the Thirty Years&rsquo; War; and on his return
he accompanied Count Nostitz to Switzerland and Italy. His
reason began to give way in 1795, and in 1801 he had to be
confined in a lunatic asylum; but by 1803 he had completely
recovered. The rest of his life was mainly spent either in Prague
or at the country seats of his friends Counts Nostitz and Czernin;
but his death took place at BrÃ¼nn, whither he had gone in 1828
to make investigations in the library. While his fame rests
chiefly on his labours in Slavonic philology his botanical studies
are not without value in the history of the science.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DOBSON, HENRY AUSTIN<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> (1840-&emsp;&emsp;), English poet and man
of letters, was born at Plymouth on the 18th of January 1840,
being the eldest son of George Clarisse Dobson, a civil engineer,
and on his grandmother&rsquo;s side of French descent. When he was
about eight years old the family moved to Holyhead, and his
first school was at Beaumaris, in the Isle of Anglesea. He was
afterwards educated at Coventry, and the Gymnase, Strassburg,
whence he returned at the age of sixteen with the intention
of becoming a civil engineer. He had a taste for art, and in
his earlier years at the office continued to study it at South
Kensington, at his leisure, but without definite ambition. In
December 1856 he entered the Board of Trade, gradually rising to
a principalship in the harbour department, from which he withdrew
in the autumn of 1901. He married in 1868 Frances Mary,
daughter of Nathaniel Beardmore of Broxbourne, Herts, and
settled at Ealing. His official career was industrious though
uneventful, but as poet and biographer he stands among the most
distinguished of his time. The student of Mr Austin Dobson&rsquo;s
work will be struck at once by the fact that it contains nothing
immature: there are no <i>juvenilia</i> to criticize or excuse. It was
about 1864 that Mr Dobson first turned his attention to composition
in prose and verse, and some of his earliest known pieces
remain among his best. It was not until 1868 that the appearance
of <i>St Paul&rsquo;s</i>, a magazine edited by Anthony Trollope, afforded
Mr Dobson an opportunity and an audience; and during the next
six years he contributed to its pages some of his favourite poems,
including &ldquo;Tu Quoque,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Gentleman of the Old School,&rdquo; &ldquo;A
Dialogue from Plato,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Une Marquise.&rdquo; Many of his poems
in their original form were illustrated&mdash;some, indeed, actually
written to support illustrations. By the autumn of 1873 Mr
Dobson had produced sufficient verse for a volume, and put forth
his <i>Vignettes in Rhyme</i>, which quickly passed through three
editions. During the period of their appearance in the magazine
the poems had received unusual attention, George Eliot, among
others, extending generous encouragement to the anonymous
author. The little book at once introduced him to a larger public.
The period was an interesting one for a first appearance, since
the air was full of metrical experiment. Swinburne&rsquo;s bold and
dithyrambic excursions into classical metre had given the clue
for an enlargement of the borders of English prosody; and, since
it was hopeless to follow him in his own line without necessary loss
of vigour, the poets of the day were looking about for fresh forms
and variations. It was early in 1876 that a small body of English
poets lit upon the French forms of Theodore de Banville, Marot
and Villon, and determined to introduce them into English verse.
Mr Austin Dobson, who had already made successful use of the
triolet, was at the head of this movement, and in May 1876 he
published in <i>The Prodigals</i> the first original ballade written in
English. This he followed by English versions of the rondel,
rondeau and villanelle. An article in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> by
Mr Edmund Gosse, &ldquo;A Plea for Certain Exotic Forms of Verse,&rdquo;
appearing in July 1877, simultaneously with Mr Dobson&rsquo;s second
volume, <i>Proverbs in Porcelain</i>, drew the general eye to the
possibilities and achievements of the movement. The experiment
was extremely fortunate in its introduction. Mr Dobson is above
all things natural, spontaneous and unaffected in poetic method;
and in his hands a sheaf of metrical forms, essentially artificial
and laborious, was made to assume the colour and bright
profusion of a natural product. An air of pensive charm, of
delicate sensibility, pervades the whole of these fresh revivals;
and it is perhaps this personal touch of humanity which has
given something like stability to one side of a movement otherwise
transitory in influence. The fashion has faded, but the
flowers of Mr Dobson&rsquo;s French garden remain bright and
scented.</p>

<p>In 1883 Mr Dobson published <i>Old-World Idylls</i>, a volume which
contains some of his most characteristic work. By this time his
taste was gradually settling upon the period with which it has
since become almost exclusively associated; and the spirit of
the 18th century is revived in &ldquo;The Ballad of Beau Brocade&rdquo;
and in &ldquo;The Story of Rosina,&rdquo; as nowhere else in modern English
poetry. In &ldquo;Beau Brocade,&rdquo; indeed, the pictorial quality of his
work, the dainty economy of eloquent touches, is at its very
best: every couplet has its picture, and every picture is true and
vivacious. The touch has often been likened to that of Randolph
Caldecott, with which it has much in common; but Mr Dobson&rsquo;s
humour is not so &ldquo;rollicking,&rdquo; his portraiture not so broad, as
that of the illustrator of &ldquo;John Gilpin.&rdquo; The appeal is rather
to the intellect, and the touches of subdued pathos in the
&ldquo;Gentleman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gentlewoman of the Old School&rdquo; are
addressed directly to the heart. We are in the 18th century, but
see it through the glasses of to-day; and the soft intercepting
sense of change which hangs like a haze between ourselves and
the subject is altogether due to the poet&rsquo;s sympathy and sensibility.
<i>At the Sign of the Lyre</i> (1885) was the next of Mr Dobson&rsquo;s
separate volumes of verse, although he has added to the body of
his work in a volume of <i>Collected Poems</i> (1897). <i>At the Sign of the
Lyre</i> contains examples of all his various moods. The admirably
fresh and breezy &ldquo;Ladies of St James&rsquo;s&rdquo; has precisely the
qualities we have traced in his other 18th-century poems; there
are ballades and rondeaus, with all the earlier charm; and in
&ldquo;A Revolutionary Relic,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;The Child Musician&rdquo; of the
<i>Old-World Idylls</i>, the poet reaches a depth of true pathos which
he does not often attempt, but in which, when he seeks it, he
never fails. At the pole opposite to these are the light occasional
verses, not untouched by the influence of Praed, but also quite
individual, buoyant and happy. But the chief novelty in <i>At the
Sign of the Lyre</i> was the series of &ldquo;Fables of Literature and Art,&rdquo;
founded in manner upon Gay, and exquisitely finished in
scholarship, taste and criticism. It is in these perhaps, more than
in any other of his poems, that we see how with much felicity Mr
Dobson interpenetrates the literature of fancy with the literature
of judgment. After 1885 Mr Dobson was engaged principally
upon critical and biographical prose, by which he has added very
greatly to the general knowledge of his favourite 18th century.
His biographies of <i>Fielding</i> (1883), <i>Bewick</i> (1884), <i>Steele</i> (1886),
<i>Goldsmith</i> (1888), <i>Walpole</i> (1890) and <i>Hogarth</i> (1879-1898) are
studies marked alike by assiduous research, sympathetic presentation
and sound criticism. It is particularly noticeable that
Mr Dobson in his prose has always added something, and often a
great deal, to our positive knowledge of the subject in question,
his work as a critic never being solely aesthetic. In <i>Four Frenchwomen</i>
(1890), in the three series of <i>Eighteenth-Century Vignettes</i>
(1892-1894-1896), and in <i>The Paladin of Philanthropy</i> (1899),
which contain unquestionably his most delicate prose work,
the accurate detail of each study is relieved by a charm of
expression which could only be attained by a poet. In 1901
he collected his hitherto unpublished poems in a volume entitled
<i>Carmina Votiva</i>. Possessing an exquisite talent of defined
range, Mr Austin Dobson may be said in his own words to
have &ldquo;held his pen in trust for Art&rdquo; with a service sincere and
distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DOBSON, WILLIAM<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (1610-1646), English portrait and
historical painter, was born in London. His father was master of
the alienation office, but by improvidence had fallen into reduced
circumstances. The son was accordingly bound an apprentice
to a stationer and picture dealer in Holborn Bridge; and while
in his employment he began to copy the pictures of Titian and
Van Dyck. He also took portraits from life under the advice
and instruction of Francis Cleyn, a German artist of considerable
repute. Van Dyck, happening to pass a shop in Snow Hill where
one of Dobson&rsquo;s pictures was exposed, sought out the artist, and
presented him to Charles I., who took Dobson under his protection,
and not only sat to him several times for his own portrait,
but caused the prince of Wales, Prince Rupert and many others
to do the same. The king had a high opinion of his artistic ability,
styled him the English Tintoretto, and appointed him serjeant-painter
on the death of Van Dyck. After the fall of Charles,
Dobson was reduced to great poverty, and fell into dissolute
habits. He died at the early age of thirty-six. Excellent
examples of Dobson&rsquo;s portraits are to be seen at Blenheim,
Chatsworth and several other country seats throughout England.
The head in the &ldquo;Decollation of St John the Baptist&rdquo; at Wilton

<p><span class="bold">DOCETAE<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span>, a name applied to those thinkers in the early
Christian Church who held that Christ, during his life, had not
a real or natural, but only an apparent (<span class="grk" title="dokein">&#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, to appear) or
phantom body. Other explanations of the <span class="grk" title="dokÃªsis">&#948;&#972;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> or appearance
have, however, been suggested, and, in the absence of any
statement by those who first used the word of the grounds on
which they did so, it is impossible to determine between them
with certainty. The name Docetae is first used by Theodoret
(<i>Ep.</i> 82) as a general description, and by Clement of Alexandria
as the designation of a distinct sect,<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> of which he says that Julius
Cassianus was the founder. Docetism, however, undoubtedly
existed before the time of Cassianus. The origin of the heresy is
to be sought in the Greek, Alexandrine and Oriental philosophizing
about the imperfection or rather the essential impurity of
matter. Traces of a Jewish Docetism are to be found in Philo;
and in the Christian form it is generally supposed to be combated
in the writings of John,<a name="fa2l" id="fa2l" href="#ft2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and more formally in the epistles of
Ignatius.<a name="fa3l" id="fa3l" href="#ft3l"><span class="sp">3</span></a> It differed much in its complexion according to the
points of view adopted by the different authors. Among the
Gnostics and Manichaeans it existed in its most developed type,
and in a milder form it is to be found even in the writings of the
orthodox teachers. The more thoroughgoing Docetae assumed
the position that Christ was born without any participation of
matter; and that all the acts and sufferings of his human life,
including the crucifixion, were only apparent. They denied
accordingly, the resurrection and the ascent into heaven. To this
class belonged Dositheus, Saturninus, Cerdo, Marcion and their
followers, the Ophites, Manichaeans and others. Marcion, for
example, regarded the body of Christ merely as an &ldquo;umbra,&rdquo; a
&ldquo;phantasma.&rdquo; His denial (due to his abhorrence of the world)
that Jesus was born or subjected to human development, is in
striking contrast to the value which he sets on Christ&rsquo;s death on
the cross. The other, or milder school of Docetae, attributed to
Christ an ethereal and heavenly instead of a truly human body.
Amongst these were Valentinus, Bardesanes, Basilides, Tatian
and their followers. They varied considerably in their estimation
of the share which this body had in the real actions and sufferings
of Christ. Clement and Origen, at the head of the Alexandrian
school, took a somewhat subtle view of the Incarnation, and
Docetism pervades their controversies with the Monarchians.
Hilary especially illustrates the prevalence of naive Docetic views
as regards the details of the Incarnation. Docetic tendencies
have also been developed in later periods of ecclesiastical history,
as for example by the Priscillianists and the Bogomils, and also
since the Reformation by Jacob Boehme, Menno Simons and a
small fraction of the Anabaptists. Docetism springs from the
same roots as Gnosticism, and the Gnostics generally held
Docetic views (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gnosticism</a></span>).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DOCK<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span>, in botany, the name applied to the plants constituting
the section <i>Lapathum</i> of the genus <i>Rumex</i>, natural order Polygonaceae.
They are biennial or perennial herbs with a stout root-stock,
and glabrous linear-lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate leaves
with a rounded, obtuse or hollowed base and a more or less wavy
or crisped margin. The flowers are arranged in more or less
crowded whorls, the whole forming a denser or looser panicle;
they are generally perfect, with six sepals, six stamens and a
three-sided ovary bearing three styles with much-divided stigmas.
The fruit is a triangular nut enveloped in the three enlarged
leathery inner sepals, one or all of which bear a tubercle. In the
common or broad-leaved dock, <i>Rumex obtusifolius</i>, the flower-stem
is erect, branching, and 18 in. to 3 ft. high, with large radical
leaves, heart-shaped at the base, and more or less blunt; the
other leaves are more pointed, and have shorter stalks. The
whorls are many-flowered, close to the stem and mostly leafless.
The root is many-headed, black externally and yellow within.
The flowers appear from June to August. In autumn the whole
plant may become of a bright red colour. It is a troublesome
weed, common by roadsides and in fields, pastures and waste
places throughout Europe. The great water dock, <i>R. hydrolapathum</i>,
believed to be the <i>herba britannica</i> of Pliny (<i>Nat. Hist.</i>
xxv. 6), is a tall-growing species; its root is used as an antiscorbutic.
Other British species are <i>R. crispus</i>; <i>R. conglomeratus</i>,
the root of which has been employed in dyeing; <i>R. sanguineus</i>
(bloody dock, or bloodwort); <i>R. palustris</i>; <i>R. pulcher</i> (fiddle
dock), with fiddle-shaped leaves; <i>R. maritimus</i>; <i>R. aquaticus</i>;
<i>R. pratensis</i>. The naturalized species, <i>R. alpinus</i>, or &ldquo;monk&rsquo;s
rhubarb,&rdquo; was early cultivated in Great Britain, and was accounted
an excellent remedy for ague, but, like many other such
drugs, is now discarded.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DOCK<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span>, in marine and river engineering. Vessels require to
lie afloat alongside quays provided with suitable appliances in
sheltered sites in order to discharge and take in cargoes conveniently
and expeditiously; and a basin constructed for this
purpose, surrounded by quay walls, is known as a dock. The
term is specially applied to basins adjoining tidal rivers, or close
to the sea-coast, in which the water is maintained at a fairly
uniform level by gates, which are closed when the tide begins to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
fall, as exemplified by the Liverpool and Havre docks (figs. 1
and 2). Sometimes, however, at ports situated on tidal rivers
near their tidal limit, as at Glasgow (fig. 3), Hamburg and
Rouen, and at some ports near the sea-coast, such as Southampton
(fig. 4) and New York, the tidal range is sufficiently moderate
for dock gates to be dispensed with, and for open basins and river
quays to serve for the accommodation of vessels. For ports
established on the sea-coast of tideless seas, such as the Mediterranean,
on account of the rivers being barred by deltas at
their outlets, like the Rhone and the Tiber, and thus rendered
inaccessible, open basins, provided with quays and protected by
breakwaters, furnish the necessary commercial requirements for
sea-going vessels, as for example at Marseilles (fig. 5), Genoa,
Naples and Trieste. These open basins, however, are precisely
the same as closed docks, except for the absence of dock gates,
and the accommodation for shipping at the quays round basins
in river ports is so frequently supplemented by river quays,
that closed docks, open basins and river quays are all naturally
included in the general consideration of dock works.</p>

<p>Low-lying land adjoining a tidal river or estuary frequently
provides suitable sites for docks; for the position, being more
or less inland, is sheltered; the low level reduces the excavation
required for forming the docks, and enables the excavated
<span class="sidenote">Sites for Docks.</span>
materials to be utilized in raising the ground at the
sides for quays, and the river furnishes a sheltered
approach channel. Notable instances of these are the
docks of the ports of London, Liverpool,
South Wales, Southampton,
Hull, Belfast, St Nazaire, Rotterdam,
Antwerp and Hamburg. Sometimes
docks are partially formed on
foreshores reclaimed from estuaries,
as at Hull, Grimsby, Cardiff, Liverpool,
Leith and Havre; whilst at
Bristol, a curved portion of the river
Avon was appropriated for a dock,
and a straight cut made for the river.
By carrying docks across sharp bends
of tidal rivers, upper and lower entrances
can be provided, thereby conveniently
separating the inland and
sea-going traffic; and of this the
London, Surrey Commercial, West
India, and Victoria and Albert docks
are examples on the Thames and
Chatham dockyard on the Medway.
Occasionally, when a small tidal river
has a shallow entrance, or an estuary exhibits signs of silting up,
docks alongside, formed on foreshores adjoining the sea-coast,
are provided with a sheltered entrance direct from the sea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
as exemplified by the Sunderland docks adjacent to the
mouth of the river Wear, and the Havre docks at the outlet
of the Seine estuary (fig. 2). Some old ports, originally established
on sandy coasts where a creek, maintained by the influx
and efflux of the tide from low-lying spaces near the shore,
afforded some shelter and an outlet to the sea across the beach,
have had their access improved by parallel jetties and dredging;
and docks have been readily formed in the low-lying land only
separated by sand dunes from the sea, as at Calais, Dunkirk
(fig. 6) and Ostend (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harbour</a></span>). In sheltered places on
the sea-coast, docks have sometimes been constructed on low-lying
land bordering the shore, with direct access to the sea,
as at Barrow and Hartlepool; whilst at Mediterranean ports
open basins have been formed in the sea, by establishing quays
along the foreshore, from which wide, solid jetties, lined with
quay walls, are carried into the sea at intervals at right angles to
the shore, being sheltered by an outlying breakwater
parallel to the coast, and reached at each
end through the openings left between the projecting
jetties and the breakwater, as at Marseilles (fig. 5)
and Trieste, and at the extensions at Genoa (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harbour</a></span>) and Naples. Where, however, the basins
are formed within the partial protection of a bay,
as in the old ports of Genoa and Naples, the requisite
additional shelter has been provided by
converging breakwaters across the opening of the
bay; and an entrance to the port is left between
the breakwaters. The two deep arms of the sea at
New York, known as the Hudson and East rivers,
are so protected by Staten Island and Long Island
that it has been only necessary to form open basins
by projecting wide jetties or quays into them from
the west and east shores of Manhattan Island, and
from the New Jersey and Brooklyn shores, at intervals,
to provide adequate accommodation for Atlantic liners
and the sea-going trade of New York.</p>

<p>The accessibility of a port depends upon the depth of its
approach channel, which also determines the depth of the docks
or basins to which it leads; for it is useless to give a
depth to a dock much in excess of the depth down to
<span class="sidenote">Approach channels.</span>
which there is a prospect of carrying the channel by
which it is reached. The great augmentation, however, in the
power and capacity for work of modern dredgers, and especially
of suction dredgers in sand (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dredge</a></span>), together with the
increasing draught of vessels, has resulted in a considerable
increase being made in the available depth of rivers and channels
leading to docks, and has necessitated the making of due
allowance for the possibility of a reasonable improvement in
determining the depth to be given to a new dock. On the other
hand, there is a limit to the deepening of an approach channel,
depending upon its length, the local conditions as regards
silting, and the resources and prospects of trade of the port, for
every addition to the depth generally involves a corresponding
increase in the cost of maintenance.</p>

<p>At tidal ports the available depth for vessels should be
reckoned from high water of the lowest neap tides, as the standard
which is certain to be reached at high tide; and the period
during which docks can be entered at each tide depends upon the
nature of the approach channel, the extent of the tidal range and
the manner in which the entrance to the docks is effected. Thus
where the tidal range is very large, as in the Severn estuary, the
approach channels to some of the South Wales ports are nearly
dry at low water of spring tides, and it would be impossible to
make these ports accessible near low tide; whereas at high
water, even of neap tides, vessels of large draught can enter their
docks. At Liverpool, with a rise of 31 ft. at equinoctial spring
tides, owing to the deep channel between Liverpool and
Birkenhead and into the outer estuary of the Mersey in Liverpool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
Bay, maintained by the powerful tidal scour resulting from the
filling and emptying of the large inner estuary, access to the
river by the largest vessels has been rendered possible, at any
state of the tide, by dredging a channel through the Mersey bar;
but the docks cannot be entered till the water has risen above
half-tide level, and the gates are closed directly after high water.
A large floating
landing-stage,
however, about
half a mile in
length, in front of
the centre of the
docks, connected
with the shore by
several hinged
bridges and rising
and falling with
the tide, enables
Atlantic liners to
come alongside and
take on board or
disembark their
passengers at any
time.</p>

<p>Comparatively
small tidal rivers
offer the best
opportunity of a
considerable improvement
in the
approach channel
to a port; for they
can be converted into artificially deep channels by dredging,
and their necessary maintenance is somewhat aided by the
increased influx and efflux of tidal water due to the lowering
of the low-water line by the outflow of the ebb tide being facilitated
by the deepening. Thus systematic, continuous dredging
in the Tyne and the Clyde has raised the Tyne ports and
Glasgow into first-class ports. In large tidal rivers and estuaries,
docks should be placed alongside a concave bank which the deep
navigable channel hugs, as effected at Hull and Antwerp, or
close to a permanently deep channel in an estuary, such as chosen
for Garston and the entrance to the Manchester ship canal at
Eastham in the inner Mersey estuary, and for Grimsby and the
authorized Illingham dock in the Humber estuary; for a channel
carried across an estuary to deep water requires constant dredging
to maintain its depth. Occasionally, extensive draining works
and dredging have to be executed to form an adequately deep
channel through a shifting estuary and shallow river to a port,
as for instance on the Weser to Bremerhaven and Bremen, on
the Seine to Honfleur and Rouen, on the Tees to Middlesborough
and Stockton, on the Ribble to Preston, on the Maas to Rotterdam
and on the Nervion to Bilbao (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">River Engineering</a></span>). Southampton
possesses the very rare combination of advantages of a
well-sheltered and fairly deep estuary, a rise of only 12 ft. at
spring tides, and a position at the head of Southampton Water
at the confluence of two rivers (fig. 4), so that, with a moderate
amount of dredging and the construction of quays along the lower
ends of the river with a depth of 35 ft. in front of them at low
water, it is possible for vessels of the largest draught to come
alongside or leave the quays at any state of the tide. This
circumstance has enabled Southampton to attract some of the
Atlantic steamers formerly running to Liverpool.</p>

<p>Ports on tideless seas have to be placed where deep water
approaches the shore, and where there is an absence of littoral
drift. The basins of such ports are always accessible for vessels
of the draught they provide for; but they require most efficient
protection, and, unlike tidal ports, they are not able <span class="correction" title="amended from to">on</span> exceptional
occasions to admit a vessel of larger draught than the
basins have been formed to accommodate. Occasionally, an old
port whose approach channel has become inadequate for modern
vessels, or from which the sea has receded, has been provided
with deep access from the sea by a ship canal, as exemplified by
Amsterdam and Bruges; whilst Manchester has become a seaport
by similar works (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Manchester Ship Canal</a></span>). In such
cases, however, perfectly sheltered open basins are formed inland
at the head of the ship canal, in the most convenient available
site; and the size of vessels that can use the port depends wholly
on the dimensions and facility of access of the ship canal.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p>Docks require to be so designed that they may provide the
maximum length of quays in proportion to the water area consistent
with easy access for vessels to the quays; but often the space
available does not admit of the adoption of
<span class="sidenote">Design of Docks.</span>
the best forms, and the design has
to be made as suitable as practicable
under the existing conditions.
On this account, and owing to the small size
of vessels in former times, the docks of old
ports present a great variety in size and
arrangement, being for the most part narrow
and small, forming a sort of string of docks
communicating with one another, and provided
with locks or entrances at suitable
points for their common use, as noticeable
in the older London and Liverpool docks.
Though narrow timber jetties were introduced
in some of the wider London docks for increasing
the length of quays by placing
vessels alongside them, no definite arrangement
of docks was adopted in carrying out
the large Victoria and Albert docks between
1850 and 1880; whilst the Victoria dock was
made wide with solid quays, provided with
warehouses, projecting from the northern
quay wall, thereby affording a large accommodation
for vessels lying end on to the
north quay, the Albert dock subsequently
constructed was given about half the width
of the earlier dock, but made much longer, so
that vessels lie alongside the north and south
quays in a long line. This change of form,
however, was probably dictated by the
advantage of stretching across the remainder
of the wide bend, in order to obtain a second
entrance in a lower reach of the river. The
Tilbury docks, the latest and lowest docks
on the Thames, were constructed on the most approved modern
system, consisting of a series of branch docks separated by wide,
well-equipped solid quays, and opening straight into a main dock
or basin communicating with the entrance lock, in which vessels
can turn on entering or leaving the docks (fig. 7). The most
recently constructed Liverpool docks, also, at the northern end
have been given this form; and the older docks adjoining them
to the south have been transformed by reconstruction into a
similar series of branch docks opening into a dock alongside the
river wall, leading to a half-tide basin or river entrances (fig. 1).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>
The Manchester and Salford docks were laid out on a precisely
similar system, which was also adopted for the most recent docks
at Dunkirk (fig. 6) and Prince&rsquo;s dock at Glasgow (fig. 3), and
at some of the principal Rhine ports; whilst the Alexandra dock at
Hull resembles it in principle. The basins in tideless seas have
naturally been long formed in accordance with this system (fig. 5).
The Barry docks furnish an example of the special arrangements
for a coal-shipping port, with numerous coal-tips served by sidings
(fig. 8).</p>

<p>Tidal basins, as they are termed, are generally interposed in the
docks of London between the entrance locks and the docks, with the
object of facilitating the passage of vessels out of and into
the docks before and after high water, by lowering the
<span class="sidenote">Tidal and half-tide basins.</span>
water in the basin as soon as the tide has risen sufficiently,
and opening the lock gates directly a level has been
formed with the tide in the river. Then the vessels which have
collected in the basin, when level with the dock, are readily passed
successively into the river. The incoming vessels are next brought
into the basin, and the gates are closed; and the water in the basin
having been raised to the level in the dock, the gates shutting off
the basin from the dock when the water was lowered are opened, and
the vessels are admitted to the dock. In this manner, by means of
an inner pair of gates, the basin can be used as a large lock without
unduly altering the water-level in the dock, and saves the delay of
locking most of the vessels out and in, the lock being only used for
the smaller vessels leaving early or coming in late on the tide. Similar
tidal basins have also been provided at Cardiff, Penarth, Barry (fig. 8),
Sunderland, Antwerp and other docks.</p>

<p>The large half-tide docks introduced at the most modern Liverpool
docks (fig. 1) serve a similar purpose as tidal basins; but being much
larger, and approached by entrances instead of locks, the exit and
entrance of vessels are effected by lowering their water-level on a
rising tide, and opening the gates, which are then closed at high water
to prevent the lowering of the water-level in the dock, and to avoid
closing the gates against a strong issuing current.</p>

<p>The tidal basins outside the locks at Tilbury and Barry are
quite open to the tide, and have been carried down to 24 ft. and 16 ft.
respectively below low water of spring tides, in order to afford vessels
a deep sheltered approach to the lock in each case, available at or
near low water (figs. 7 and 8). Such basins, however, open to a
considerable tidal range where the water is densely charged with
silt, are exposed to a large deposit in the fairly still water, and their
depth has to be constantly maintained by sluicing or dredging.</p>

<p>Where the range of tide is moderate, or on large inland rivers,
docks or basins are usefully supplemented by river quays, which
though subject to changes in the water-level, and exposed
to currents in the river, are very convenient for access,
<span class="sidenote">River quays.</span>
and are sometimes very advantageously employed in
regulating a river and keeping up its banks when deepened by
dredging. Generally 10 to 12 ft. is the limit of the tidal range convenient
for the adoption of open basins and river quays; but the
banks of the Tyne have been utilized for quays, jetties and coal-staiths,
with a somewhat larger maximum tidal range; and a long
line of quays stretching along the right bank of the Scheldt in front
of Antwerp, constructed so as to regulate this reach of the river,
accommodates a large sea-going traffic, with a rise at spring tides
of 15 ft.</p>

<p>When a dock has to be formed on land, the excavation is effected
by men with barrows and powerful steam navvies, loading into
wagons drawn in trains by locomotives to the place of
deposit, usually to raise the land at the sides for forming
<span class="sidenote">Excavations for docks.</span>
quays. Directly the underground water-level is reached,
the water has to be removed from the excavations by
pumps raising the inflowing water from sumps, lined with timber,
sunk down below the lowest foundations at suitable positions, so
that the lower portions of the dock walls and sills of the lock or
entrance may be built out of water. A cofferdam has to be constructed
extending out from the bank of the river or approach channel
in front of the site of the proposed entrance or lock, so that the
excavations for the entrance to the dock may be pushed forwards,
and the lock or entrance built under its protection. Sometimes the
lowest portion of the excavation for the dock can be accomplished
economically by dredging, after the dock walls and lock have been
completed and the water admitted.</p>

<p>Where a dock is partially or wholly constructed on reclaimed land,
the reclamation bank for enclosing the site and excluding the tide
has to be undertaken first by tipping an embankment from each
end with wagons, protected and consolidated along its outer toe
by rubble stone or chalk. When the ends of the embankments are
approaching one another, it is essential to connect them by a long
low bank of selected materials brought up gradually in successive
layers, and retaining the water in the enclosure to the level of this
bank, so that the influx and efflux of the tide, filling and emptying
the reclaimed area, may take place over a long length, and in smaller
volume as the low bank is raised. In this way a reduction is effected
of the tidal current in and out, which in the case of a large enclosure
and a considerable tidal range, would create such a scour in the
narrowing gap between two high embankments as to wash away
their ends and prevent the closing of the gap. Occasionally the final
closure is effected by lowering timber panels in grooves between
a series of piles driven down at intervals across the gap. On the
closing of the reclamation bank the water is pumped out; and
the excavation is carried on in the ordinary manner. It is very
important that such an embankment should be carried well above
the level of the highest tide which might be raised by a high wind;
and in exposed sites, the outer slope of the bank should be protected
by pitching from the action of waves, for any overtopping or erosion
of the bank might result in a large breach through it, and the flooding
of the works inside.</p>

<p>Docks are generally surrounded by walls retaining the quays,
alongside which vessels lie for discharging and taking in cargoes.
In order to ascertain the nature of the strata upon which
these walls have to be founded, borings are taken at the
<span class="sidenote">Foundations for dock walls.</span>
outset to the requisite depth at intervals near the line
of the walls, but inside the dock area if the piercing of
quicksand is anticipated, as in excavating for the foundations, these
holes might give rise to the outflow, under pressure, of underlying
quicksand into the foundations. As docks are generally formed near
rivers or estuaries, these strata are commonly alluvial; but being
situated at some depth below the surface, they are usually fairly
hard. When they consist of gravel, clay or firm sand, the walls
can be founded on the natural bottom excavated a few feet below
the bottom of the dock, their weight being somewhat distributed by
making them rest on a broad bed of concrete filling up the excavation
at the bottom. When, however, fine sand or silt charged with
water, or quicksand is met with at the required depth, the necessary
pumping and excavation for the foundations might occasion the
influx of sand or silt with the water into the excavations, leading
to settlement and slips; or the soft stratum might be too thick to
remove. The wall may then be founded on bearing piles driven down
to a solid stratum, and having their tops joined together by walings
and planking, or by a layer of concrete, upon which the wall is built.
Or the soft stratum can be enclosed with a double row of sheet piling
along the front and back of the line of wall, by which it sometimes
becomes sufficiently confined and consolidated to sustain the weight
of the wall on a broad foundation of concrete; or it can be excavated
without any danger of sand or silt running in from outside; whilst
the sheet piling at the back relieves the wall to some extent from
the pressure of the earth behind it, and in front retains the wall from
sliding forwards. Firmer foundations have been obtained by sinking
brick, concrete or masonry wells through soft ground to a solid
stratum, upon which the dock wall is built. Clusters of small concrete
cylinders, in sets of three in front, and a line of double cylinders at
the back, were used for the foundations of the walls of Prince&rsquo;s dock
at Glasgow. Wells of rubble masonry were sunk in the silty foreshore
of the Seine estuary for the walls of the Bellot docks at Havre;
and they served as piers, connected by arches, for the foundations of a
continuous dock wall above, being carried down to a considerable
depth through alluvium at the St Nazaire, Bordeaux and Rochefort
docks. These well foundations, derived from the old Indian system,
are built up upon a curb, sometimes furnished with a cutting edge
underneath, and gradually sunk by excavating inside; and eventually
the central hollow is filled up solid with concrete or masonry.</p>

<p>The walls round a dock serve as retaining walls to keep up the
quays; and though they have the support of the water in front of
them when the docks are in use, they have to sustain the full pressure
of the filling at the back on the completion of the dock before the
water is admitted. They have, accordingly, to be increased in
<span class="sidenote">Dock walls.</span>
thickness downwards to support the pressure increasing
with the depth. This pressure, with perfectly dry material,
would be represented by the weight of half the prism of
filling between the natural slope of the material behind and the back
of the wall; but the pressure is often increased by the accumulation
of water at the back, which, with fine silty
backing, is liable to exert a sort of fluid
pressure against the wall proportionate to
the density of the mixture of silt and water.
The increase of thickness towards the base
used formerly to be effected by a batter on
the face, as well as by steps out at the back;
but the vertical form now given to the sides
of large vessels necessitates a corresponding
fairly vertical face for the wall, to prevent
the upper part of the vessel being kept
unduly away from the quay. Examples of
the most modern types of dock walls are
given in figs. 9 to 12.</p>

<p>The height of a dock wall depends upon
the depth of water always available for
vessels, at tideless sea-ports and at ports
removed from tidal influences, such as Manchester,
Bruges and the ports on the Rhine;
this depth should not be less than 28 to 30 ft. for large sea-going
vessels, together with a margin of 5 to 8 ft. above the normal water-level
for the quays, and the foundations below. At tidal ports,
however, an addition has to be made equal to the difference in
height between the high-water levels of spring and neap tides; so
that at ports with a large tidal range, such as the South Wales
ports on the Severn estuary and Liverpool, specially high dock
walls are necessary. Under normal conditions, a dock wall should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span>
be given a width at a height half-way between dock-bottom and
quay-level, equal to one-third of its height above dock-bottom, and
a width of half this height at dock-bottom.</p>

<p>Dock walls are constructed of masonry,
brickwork or concrete, or of concrete with a
facing of masonry or brickwork. Masonry is
adopted where large stone quarries are readily
accessible, in the form of rubble masonry with
dressed stone on the face, as for instance at
the Hull and Barry docks, and forms a very
durable wall; but strong overhead staging
carrying powerful gantries is necessary for
laying large blocks. Brickwork has been often
used where bricks are the ordinary building
material of the district or can be made on the
works, and requires only ordinary scaffolding;
and harder or pressed bricks are employed for
the facework. Concrete is very commonly
resorted to now where sand and stones are
readily procured; and where clean, sharp
sand and gravel are found in thick layers in
the excavations for a dock, as in the alluvial
strata bordering the Thames, dock walls can
be constructed cheaply and economically with
concrete deposited within timber framing,
dispensing with regular scaffolding and skilled
labour. Such walls require to be given a facing of stronger concrete,
or of blue bricks, as at Tilbury, to guard against abrasion
by vessels, chains and ropes; and dock walls are commonly provided
at the top with granite or other hard stone coping where the
wear is greatest. The foundations for dock walls are excavated in
a trench below dock-bottom, only lined
with timbering where the faces of the
trench cannot stand for a short time
without support, and with sheet piling
through very unstable silt or sand; and
the trench is conveniently filled up solid
with concrete, carried out in short lengths
in untrustworthy ground. To reduce
the amount of filling behind the wall, the
excavation at the back above dock-bottom,
preparatory for the trench, is
given as steep a slope as practicable,
supported sometimes towards the base
by timbering and struts; but occasionally
the wall is built within a timbered
trench carried down to the required
depth, before the excavation for the
dock in front of it has been executed, as
effected at Tilbury. The filling at the
back is thus reduced to a minimum, and
the lower portion of the excavation can
be accomplished by dredging, if expedient,
after the admission of the water, the
dock wall in this way being exposed to the least possible pressure behind.</p>

<p>The walls of open basins are often constructed out of water
precisely like dock walls, as in the case of the basins forming the
Manchester, Bruges and Glasgow docks; and basin walls open
to the tide, as at Glasgow and in the tidal basin outside Tilbury
docks (fig. 7), differ only from dock
walls in being exposed to variations
in the pressure at the back resulting
from the lowering of the water-level
in front, which is, indeed, shared to
some extent by the walls round closed
docks where the difference in the high-water
levels of springs and neaps
is considerable. The walls, however,
round basins in tideless seas, such as
Marseilles, occasionally those inside
harbours, and especially quay walls
along rivers and round open basins
alongside rivers, have to be constructed
under water.</p>

<p>At Marseilles, the simple expedient
was long ago adopted of constructing
the quay walls lining the basins formed
in the sea, by depositing tiers of large
concrete blocks on a rubble foundation,
one on top of the other, till they
<span class="sidenote">Open basin and river quay walls founded under water.</span>
reached sea-level, and then building a solid masonry quay wall
out of water on the top up to quay-level, faced with ashlar
(fig. 13), the wall being backed by rubble for some distance
behind up to the water-level. The same system was employed
for the quay walls at Trieste, and at Genoa and
other Italian ports. A quay wall inside Marmagao harbour,
on the west coast of India, was erected on a foundation
layer of rubble by the sloping-block system, to
provide against unequal settlement on the soft bottom (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Breakwater</a></span>).
The quay walls alongside the river Liffey, and round the
adjacent basins below Dublin, were erected under water by building
rubble-concrete blocks of 360 tons on staging carried out into the
water, from which they
were lifted one by one by a
powerful floating derrick,
which conveyed the block
to the site, and deposited
it on a levelled bottom at
low tide in a depth of 28
ft., raising the wall a little
above low water. After a
row of these blocks had
been laid, and connected
together by filling the
grooves formed at the sides
and the interstices between
the blocks with concrete,
a continuous masonry wall
faced with ashlar was built
on the top out of water. A
quay wall was built up to
a little above low water on
a similar principle at Cork, with three smaller blocks as a foundation,
in lengths of 8 ft. Cylindrical well foundations have been
extensively used for the foundations of the quay walls along the
Clyde, formerly made of brick, but subsequently of concrete, sunk
through a considerable variety of alluvial strata, but mostly sand
and gravel fully
charged with water.
Compressed air in
bottomless caissons
has been increasingly
employed in
recent years for
carrying down the
subaqueous foundations
of river quay
walls, through alluvial
deposits, to a
solid stratum.
About 1880, a long
line of river quays
was commenced in
front of Antwerp,
extending in the
central portion a
considerable distance
out into the
Scheldt, with the
object of regulating
the width of the
river simultaneously
with the provision
of deep quays for
sea-going vessels;
and the quay wall was erected, out of water, on the flat tops of a
series of wrought-iron caissons, 82 ft. long and 29Â½ ft. wide, constructed
on shore, floated out one by one to their site in the river
between two barges, and gradually lowered as the wall was built up
inside a plate-iron enclosure round the roof of the caisson, which
was eventually sunk by
aid of compressed air
through the bed of the
river to a compact
stratum (fig. 14). The
weight of the wall
counteracted the tendency
of the caisson
and the enclosure
above it to float; and
the caisson, furnished
with seven circular
wrought-iron shafts,
provided with air-locks
at the top for the admission
of men and
materials and for the
removal of the excavations,
was gradually
carried down by excavating
inside the
working chamber at
the bottom, 6Â¼ ft. high, till a good foundation was reached. The
working chamber was then filled with concrete through some of the
shafts, the plate-iron sides of the upper enclosure were removed to
be used for another length of wall, the shafts were drawn out and
the hollows left by them filled with concrete, the apertures between
adjacent lengths were closed at each face with wooden panels and
filled with concrete, and a continuous quay wall was completed
above. The most recent quay walls constructed in the old harbour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
at Genoa were founded under water on a rubble mound in a similar
manner by the aid of compressed air (fig. 15). Quay walls also on
the Clyde have been founded on caissons, consisting of a bottomless
steel structure, surmounted by a brick superstructure having
hollows filled with concrete, in lengths of 80 ft. and 27 ft., and
widths of 18 ft. and 21 ft. respectively, carried down by means of
compressed air from 54 to 70 ft. below quay-level, on the top
of which a continuous wall of concrete, faced with brickwork,
and having a
granite coping,
was built up from
near low-water
level (fig. 16). In
many cases where
soft strata extend
to considerable
depths, river
quays and basin
walls have been
constructed by
building a light
quay wall upon a
series of bearing
and raking piles
driven into, and
if possible
through, the soft
alluvium. Thus
the walls along the Seine, and round the basins at Rouen, were built
upon bearing piles carried down through the alluvial bed of the river
to the chalk. The lower portion of the quay wall was constructed
of concrete faced with brickwork within water-tight timber caissons,
resting upon the piles at a depth of 9Â¾ ft. below low water; and upon
this a rubble wall faced with bricks was erected from low water to
quay-level, backed by rubble stone laid on a timber flooring supported
by piles, together with chalk, to form a quay right back to
the top of the slope of the bank of the deepened river (fig. 17). The
quay walls of the open
basins bordering the
Hudson river at New
York have had, in certain
parts, to be founded
on bearing piles combined
with raking piles,
driven into a thick bed
of soft silt where no firm
stratum could be reached,
and where, therefore, the
weight could only be
borne by the adherence
of the long piles in the
silt. Before driving the
piles, however, the silt
round the upper part of
the piles and under the
quay wall was consolidated
by depositing small
stones in a trench dredged
to a depth of 30 ft. below
low water; the piles
were driven through these stones, and were further kept in place
by a long toe of rubble stone in front and a backing of rubble stone
behind carried nearly up to quay-level, behind which a light filling
of ashes and earth was raised to quay-level. The slight quay wall
resting upon the front rows of bearing piles was carried up under
water by 70-ton concrete blocks deposited by means of a floating
derrick; and the upper part of the wall was built of concrete faced
with ashlar masonry (fig. 18). The basin and quay walls at Bremen,
Bremerhaven and Hamburg were built on a series of bearing and
raking piles driven down to a firm stratum, the wall being begun
a few feet below low water. At Southampton, ferro-concrete piles
were employed in constructing the deep quays; and a wharfing of
timber pilework has been frequently used for river quays.</p>

<p>Where the increase of trade is moderate and the conditions of the
traffic permit, and also at coal-shipping ports, economy in construction
is obtained by giving sloping sides to a portion of a dock in place
of dock walls, the slope being pitched where necessary with stone;
and the length of the slope projecting into a dock is sometimes
reduced by substituting sheet piling for the slope at the toe up to
a certain height. By this arrangement jetties can be carried out
across the slope as required, enabling vessels to lie against their
ends; and coal-tips are very conveniently extended out across the
slope at suitable intervals (fig. 8).</p>

<p>As dock walls, especially before the admission of water into the
dock, constitute high retaining walls, not infrequently founded upon
soft or slippery strata, and backed up with the excavated materials
from alluvial beds, into which water is liable to percolate,
<span class="sidenote">Failures of dock walls.</span>
they are naturally exposed under unfavourable conditions
to the danger of failure. A dock wall erected on unsatisfactory
foundations is liable, where the bottom is soft, to
settle down at its toe, owing to the pressure at the back, and to
fall forwards into the dock, as occurred at Belfast; or where the
silty bottom slips forward under the weight of the backing, the
wall may follow the slip at the bottom and settle down at the back,
falling to some extent backwards, as exemplified by the failure of
the Empress basin wall at Southampton. The most common form,
however, of failure is the sliding forwards of a dock wall, with little
or no subsidence, on a silty or slippery stratum under the pressure
imposed by the backing. Thus the Kidderpur dock walls furnish an
instance of sliding forwards on muddy silt, and part of the South
West India dock walls on two underlying, detached, slippery seams
of London clay.</p>

<p>To avoid these failures with untrustworthy foundations, great care
has to be exercised in selecting the best hard material available,
unaffected by water, for the backing, which should be brought up
in thin, horizontal layers carefully consolidated; and where there
is a possibility of water accumulating at the back, pipes should be
introduced at intervals near the bottom right through the wall in
building it, and rubble stone deposited close to the back of the wall,
so as to carry off any water from behind, these pipes being stopped up
just before the water is let into the dock. These precautions, moreover,
are assisted by reducing the amount of backing to a minimum
in the construction of the wall, best effected by building the wall
inside a timbered trench. The liability to slide forwards can be
obviated by carrying down the foundations of the wall sufficiently
below dock-bottom to provide an efficient buttress of earth in front
of the wall, and also by making the base of the wall slope down
towards the back, thereby forcing the wall in sliding forwards to
mount the slope, or to push forward a larger mass of earth; whilst
a row of sheet piling in front of the foundations offers a very effectual
impediment to a forward movement, and, in combination with
bearing piles, prevents settlement at the toe in soft ground. In
very treacherous foundations it may be advisable to defer the
completion of the backing till after the admission of the water; but
the additional stability given to a retaining wall or reservoir dam by
an ample batter in front, is precluded in dock walls by the modern
requirements of vessels.</p>

<p>Silt accumulates in docks where the lowering of the water-level
by locking, the drawing down of half-tide basins, and the raising of
the water at spring tides, involve the admission of considerable
volumes of tidal water heavily charged with silt,
which is deposited in still water and has to be periodically
<span class="sidenote">Maintenance of depth.</span>
removed by dredging. To avoid this, the water is sometimes
replenished from some clear inland source, an arrangement
adopted at some of the South Wales ports opening into the muddy
Severn estuary, and at the Alexandra dock, Hull, to exclude the
silty waters of the Humber. At the Kidderpur docks on the HÃºgli,
the water from the river for replenishing the docks is conducted by a
circuitous canal, in which it deposits its burden of silt before it is
pumped into the docks.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to deal expeditiously with the cargoes and goods
brought into and despatched from docks, numerous sidings
communicating with the railways of the district are
arranged along the quays, which are also provided
<span class="sidenote">Equipment on quays.</span>
with steam, hydraulic or electric travelling cranes at
intervals alongside the docks, basins or river, for discharging
or loading vessels, and with sheds and warehouses for the storage
of merchandise, &amp;c., the arrangements depending largely upon
the special trade of the port. Though different sources of power
are sometimes made use of at different parts of the same port,
as for example at Hamburg, where the numerous cranes are
worked by steam, hydraulic power or most recently by electricity,
and a few by gas engines, it is generally most convenient
to work the various installations by one form of power from a
central station. Water-pressure has been very commonly used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
as the motive power at docks, being generated by a steam-engine
and stored up by one or more accumulators, from which
the water is transmitted under pressure through strong cast-iron
pipes to the hydraulic engines which actuate the cranes, lifts,
coal-tips, capstans, swing-bridges and gate machinery throughout
the docks (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Power Transmission</a></span>: <i>Hydraulic</i>). The
intermittent working of the machinery in docks results in a
considerable variation in the power needed at different times;
but economical working is secured by arranging that when the
accumulators are full, steam is automatically shut off from the
pumping engines, but is supplied again as soon as water is drawn
off. Electricity affords another means for the economical transmission
of power to a distance suited for intermittent working;
as far back as 1902 it was being adopted at Hamburg as the
source of power for the machinery of the extensive additional
basins then recently opened for traffic.</p>

<p>At ports where the principal trade is the export of coal from
neighbouring collieries, special provision has to be made for its
rapid shipment. Coal-tips, accordingly, are erected
at the sides of the dock in these ports, with sidings on
<span class="sidenote">Coal-tips.</span>
the quays at the back for receiving the trains of coal trucks, from
which two lines of way diverge to each coal-tip, one serving for
the conveyance of the full wagons one by one to the tip, after
passing over a weigh-bridge, and the other for the return of the
empty wagons to the siding where the empty train is made up
for returning to the colliery (fig. 8). Each full wagon is either
run at a low level upon a cradle at the tip, then raised on the
cradle within a wrought-iron lattice tower to a suitable height,
and lastly, tipped up at the back for discharging the coal; or it
is brought along a high-level road on to a cradle raised to this
level on the tower, and tipped up at this or some slightly modified
level. The coal is discharged down an adjustable iron shoot,
gradually narrowed so as to check the fall; and on first discharging
into the hold of a vessel, an anti-breakage box is suspended
below the mouth of the shoot. When full, this is lowered
to the bottom of the hold and emptied, thereby gradually forming
a cone of coal upon which the coal can be discharged directly
from the shoot without danger of breakage. Other contrivances
are also adopted with the same object.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p>In designing dock works, it is expedient to make provision, as
far as possible, for future extensions as the trade of the port increases.
Generally this can be effected alongside tidal rivers and estuaries
by utilizing sites lower down the river, as carried out on
<span class="sidenote">Dock extensions.</span>
the Thames for the port of London, or reclaiming unoccupied
foreshores of an estuary, as adopted for extensions
of the ports of Liverpool, Hull and Havre. At ports on the sea-coast
of tideless seas, it is only necessary to extend the outlying breakwater
parallel to the shore line, and form additional basins under its
shelter, as at Marseilles (fig. 5) and Genoa (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harbour</a></span>). Quays
also along rivers furnish very valuable opportunities of readily
extending the accommodation of ports. Ports, however, established
inland like Manchester, though extremely serviceable in converting
an inland city into a seaport, are at the disadvantage of having to
acquire very valuable land for any extensions that may be required;
but, nevertheless, some compensation is afforded by the complete
shelter in which the extensions can be carried out, when compared
with Liverpool, where the additions to the docks can only be effected
by troublesome reclamation works along the foreshore to the north,
in increasingly exposed situations.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Dock Entrances and Locks.</i>&mdash;The size of vessels which a port
can admit depends upon the depth and width of the entrance
to the docks; for, though the access of vessels is also governed
by the depth of the approach channel, this channel is often
capable of being further deepened to some extent by dredging;
whereas the entrance, formed of solid masonry or concrete,
cannot be adapted, except by troublesome and costly works
sometimes amounting to reconstruction, to the increasing
dimensions of vessels. Accordingly, in designing new dock
works with entrances and locks, it is essential to look forward
to the possible future requirements of vessels. The necessity for
such forethought is illustrated by the rapid increase which has
taken place in the size of the largest ocean liners. Thus the
&ldquo;City of Rome,&rdquo; launched in 1881, is 560 ft. long, and 52Â¼ ft. beam,
and has a maximum recorded draught of 27Â½ ft.; the &ldquo;Campania&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Lucania,&rdquo; in 1893, measure 600 ft. by 65 ft.; the &ldquo;Oceanic,&rdquo;
in 1899, 685Â½ ft. by 68Â¼ ft., with a maximum draught of 31<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> ft.;
the &ldquo;Baltic,&rdquo; in 1903, 709 ft. by 75 ft., with a maximum draught
of 31Â¾ ft.; and the &ldquo;Lusitania&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mauretania,&rdquo; launched in
1906, 787Â½ ft. by 88 ft.</p>

<p>The width and depth of access to docks are of more importance
than the length of locks; for docks which are reached through
entrances with a single pair of gates have to admit
vessels towards high water when the water-level in the
<span class="sidenote">Dimensions of entrances and locks.</span>
dock is the same as in the approach channel, or through
a half-tide basin drawn down to the level of the water
outside, and are therefore accessible to vessels of any length,
provided the width of the entrance and depth over the sill are
adequate; whilst at docks which are entered through locks,
vessels which are longer than the available length of the lock can
get in at high water when both pairs of gates of the lock are open.
Open basins are generally given an ample width of entrance, and
river quays also are always accessible to the longest and broadest
vessels; but in a tidal river the available depth has to be reckoned
from the lowest low water of spring tides, instead of from the
lowest high water of neap tides, if the vessels in the open basins
and alongside the river quays have to be always afloat.</p>

<p>Many years ago the Canada lock at Liverpool, the outer North
lock at Birkenhead, the Ramsden lock and entrance at Barrow-in-Furness,
and the Eure entrance at Havre, were given a width
of 100 ft. Probably this was done with the view of admitting
paddle steamers, since subsequent entrances at Liverpool were
given widths of 80 and 65 ft.; whereas none of the locks in
the port of London has been made wider than 80 ft., which has
been the standard maximum width since the completion of the
Victoria dock in 1866. The widest locks at Cardiff are 80 ft., and
the entrance to the Barry docks is the same; but the lock of the
Alexandra dock, Hull, opened in 1885, was made 85 ft. wide.
At Liverpool, where the access to the docks is mainly through
entrances, on account of the small width between the river and
the high ground rising at the back, and where ample provision
has to be made for the largest Atlantic liners, though the entrances
to the Langton dock, completed in 1881, leading to the latest
docks at the northern end were made 65 ft. wide, with their sills
3 ft. below low water of spring tides and 20Â½ ft. below high water
of the lowest neap tides, the two new entrances to the deepened
Brunswick dock near the southern end, giving access to the
adjacent reconstructed docks, completed in 1906, were made 80
and 100 ft. wide, with sills 28 ft. below high water of the lowest
neap tides. Moreover, the three new entrances to the new Sandon
half-tide dock, completed in 1906, communicating with the
reconstructed line of docks to the south of the Canada basin, and
with the latest northern extensions of the Liverpool docks, were
made 40 ft. wide with a depth over the sill of 24Â½ ft., and 80 and
100 ft. wide on each end of the central entrance, with sills 29 ft.
below high water of the lowest neap tides, each entrance being
provided with two pairs of gates, in case of any accident occurring
to one pair, according to the regular custom at Liverpool.
Powers were also obtained in 1906 for the construction of a half-tide
dock and two branch docks to the north of the Hornby dock,
which are to be reached from the river by two entrances designed
to be 130 ft. wide, with sills 38Â½ ft. below high water of the lowest
neap tides, so as to meet fully the assumed future increase in the
beam and draught of the largest vessels; whilst the authorized
extension of the river wall northwards will enable additional
docks to be constructed in communication with these entrances
when required.</p>

<p>Though, with the exception of Southampton and Dover, other
British ports do not aim, like Liverpool, at accommodating the
largest Atlantic liners at all times, the depths of the sills at the
principal ports have been increased in the most recent extensions.
Thus at the port of London the sills of the first lock of the Albert
dock were 26Â½ ft. below high water of neap tides, and of the
second lock adjoining, 32Â½ ft. deep; whilst the sills of the lock
of the Tilbury docks are 40Â½ ft. below high water of neap tides.
Moreover, in spite of the great range of tide at the South Wales
ports on the Severn estuary, the available depth at high water
of neap tides of 25 ft. at the Roath lock, Cardiff, was increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>
in the lock of the new dock to 31Â½ ft.; the depth at the entrance
to the Barry docks, opened in 1889, was 29Â½ ft., but at the lock
opened in 1896 was made 41<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> ft.; whilst a depth of 34 ft. has
been proposed for the new lock of the Alexandra dock extension
at Newport, nearly 10 ft. deeper than the existing lock sills there.
Similar improvements in depth have also been made or designed
at other ports to provide for the increasing draught of vessels.</p>

<p>The length of locks has also been increased, from 550 ft. at the
Albert dock, to 700 ft. at Tilbury in the port of London, from
300 ft. to 550 ft. at Hull, and from 350 ft. to 660 ft. at Cardiff.
The lock at the Barry docks is 647 ft. long, though only 65 ft.
wide. A lock constructed in connexion with the improvement
works at Havre, carried out in 1896-1907, was given an available
length of 805 ft. and a width of 98Â½ ft., with a depth over the sills
of 34Â¾ ft. at high water of neap tides.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p>Entrances with a single pair of gates, closing against a raised sill
at the bottom and meeting in the centre, have to be made long
enough to provide a recess in each side wall at the back to receive
the gates when they are opened, and to form a buttress in front on
<span class="sidenote">Entrances to docks.</span>
each side to bear the thrust of the gates when closed
against a head of water inside. A masonry floor is laid
on the bottom in continuation of the sill, serving as an
apron against erosion by water leaking between or under the gates,
and by the current through the sluiceways in the gates, when
opened for scouring the entrance channel or to assist in lowering the
water in a half-tide dock for opening the gates (fig. 19). A sluiceway
in each side wall, closed by a vertical sluice-gate, generally
provided in duplicate in case of accidents and worked by a machine
actuated by hydraulic pressure, enables the half-tide basin to be
brought down to the level of the approach channel outside with a
rising tide, so that vessels may be brought into or passed out of the
basin towards high water. The advantages of these entrances are,
that they occupy comparatively little room where the space is limited,
and are much less costly than locks; whilst in conjunction with a
half-tide basin they serve the same purpose as a lock with a rising
tide. Vessels also pass more readily through the short entrances
than through locks; and as entrances are only used towards high
water, their sills need not be placed so low as the outer sills of locks
to accommodate vessels of large draught. On the other hand, they
are accessible for a more limited period at each tide than locks;
and they do not allow of the exclusion of silt-bearing tidal water,
and therefore necessitate a greater amount of dredging in the docks,
and especially in half-tide basins, for maintenance. Entrances,
however, at large ports are frequently supplemented by the addition
of a lock at some convenient site, rendering the ports accessible for
the smaller class of vessels for some time before and after high water,
as for instance at Liverpool, Barry, Havre and St Nazaire. A
small basin with an entrance at each end&mdash;an arrangement often
adopted&mdash;is in reality, for all practical purposes, a lock with a very
large lock-chamber. An entrance or passage with gates has also to
be provided at the inner end of a large half-tide basin like the basins
adopted at Liverpool, to shut off the half-tide basin from the docks
to which it gives access, and maintain their water-level when the
water is drawn down in the basin to admit vessels before high tide.</p>

<p>Reverse gates pointing outwards are sometimes added in passages
to docks and at entrances, to render the water-level in one set of
docks independent of adjacent docks, to exclude silty tidal water and
very high tides, and also to protect the gates of outer entrances in
exposed situations from swell, which might force them open slightly
and lead to a damaging shock on their closing again.</p>

<p>Locks differ from entrances in having a pair of gates with arrangements
similar to an entrance at each end, separated from one
another by a lock-chamber, which should be large enough
to receive the longest and broadest vessel coming regularly
<span class="sidenote">Locks at docks.</span>
to the port. These dock locks are similar in principle to
locks on canals and canalized rivers, but are on a much larger scale.
The lock-chamber has its water raised or lowered in proportion to
the difference in level between the water-level in the dock and the
water in the entrance channel, by passing water, when the gates are
closed at both ends, from the dock into the lock-chamber or from
the lock-chamber into the entrance channel, through large sluiceways
in the side walls, controlled, as at entrances, by vertical sluice-gates.
In this way the vessel is raised or lowered in the chamber, till, when
a level has been reached, the intervening pair of gates is opened
and the vessel is passed into the dock or out to the channel. Generally
the upper and lower sills of a lock are at the same level, a foot
or two higher than dock-bottom; and the depth at which they are
laid is governed by the same considerations as the sill of an entrance.
Vessels longer than the available length between the two pairs of
gates can be admitted close to high water, when the water in the
dock and outside is at the same level, and both pairs of gates can be
opened. When the range of tide at a port is large, and the depth in
the approach channel is sufficient to allow vessels to come up or go out
some time before and after high water, and also where the water in
the dock is kept up to a high level from an inland source to exclude
very silty tidal water, it is expedient to reduce the cost of construction
by limiting the depth of the excavations for the dock, and
consequently also the height of the dock walls, to what is necessary
to provide a sufficient depth of water below high water of the lowest
neap tides, or below the water-level to which the water in the dock is
always maintained, for the vessels of largest draught frequenting the
port, or those which may be reasonably expected in the near future.
The upper sill of the lock is then determined by the level of dock-bottom;
but the lower sill is taken down approximately to the depth
of the bottom of the approach channel, or to the depth to which it
can be carried by dredging, so as to enable the lock to admit or let
out at any time all vessels which can navigate the approach channel.
Thus, for instance, the outer and intermediate sills of the lock at the
Barry docks are 9 ft. lower then the upper sill.</p>

<p>The foundations for the sill and side walls at each end of a lock,
and also for the side walls and invert commonly enclosing the lock-chamber
at the sides and bottom, are generally constructed simultaneously
with the dock works, under shelter of a cofferdam across
the entrance channel, and in the excavations kept dry by means of
pumps. The foundations under the sills and adjacent side walls are
carried down to a lower level than the rest, and if possible to a water-tight
stratum, to prevent infiltration of water under them owing to
the water-pressure on the upper side of the gates; or sometimes one
or two rows of sheet piling have been driven across the lock under the
sills to an impermeable stratum, to stop any flow. The foundations
for the sills consist usually of concrete deposited in a trench extended
out under the adjoining side walls. The sill, projecting generally
about 2 ft. above the adjacent gate floor over which the gates turn,
is built of granite; and the same material is also used for the hollow
quoins in which the heelpost, or pivot, of the dock gates turns, and
which, together with the sills, are exposed to considerable wear.
The side walls of the lock-chamber are very similar in construction
to the dock walls; but they are strengthened against the loss of
water-pressure in front of them when the water is lowered in the
chamber by an inverted arch of masonry, brickwork or concrete,
termed an &ldquo;invert,&rdquo; laid across the bottom of the chamber along
its whole length, against which the toe of each side wall abuts and
effectually prevents any forward movement. The side walls also,
alongside the gates at each end, abut against a thick level gate floor
and apron, and, moreover, are considerably widened to provide space
for the sluiceways and gate machinery.</p>

<p>The new Florida lock (fig. 20), forming the main entrance through
the new approach harbour and tidal harbour to the Eure dock and
other docks of the port of Havre, is the largest lock hitherto constructed.
It has an available length of chamber between the gates
of 805 ft., a width of 98Â½ ft., and depths over the sills of 15Â¾ ft. at
the lowest low water of spring tides, 23Â½ ft. at low water of neap tides,
35 ft. at high water of neap tides, and 40Â½ ft. at high water of spring
tides. Owing to the alluvial stratum at the site of the lock close to
the Seine estuary, of which it doubtless at one time formed part, the
foundations for the sill and side walls or heads at each end of the
lock were executed by aid of compressed air. The foundations for
these heads were carried down to an impermeable stratum by means
of two bottomless caissons, filled eventually with concrete, 213Â½ ft.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>
long across the lock and 105 ft. wide in the line of the lock at the upper
end, and 206Â¾ ft. long and 116Â½ ft. wide at the lower end, to a depth
of 18 ft. below the sill at the upper end, and 41 ft. at the lower end,
owing to the dip down seawards and southward of the water-tight
stratum. These caissons were provided for their sinkage with
temporary dams of masonry closing the opening of the lock at the
extremities of each caisson, enabling the gates to be subsequently
erected under their shelter. The junctions between the foundations
of the heads and the adjacent foundations were effected by small
movable caissons carried down in recesses provided in the buried
caissons. The connexions with the adjacent quay walls were accomplished
by two supplementary side caissons at the end of each
head; and the north side wall of the lock was founded by means of
seven bottomless caissons sunk by aid of compressed air, on account
of the proximity of the tidal harbour on that side. The south side
wall was founded for a length of about 200 ft. at its western end in
an excavated trench kept dry by pumping; but the greater portion
was founded in a dredged trench in which bearing piles were driven
under water, on which the masonry was built in successive layers,
about 3Â¼ ft. thick, in a movable caisson 93Â½ ft. long and 37Â¾ ft. wide;
whilst a bottomless caisson, left in the work, was employed for
founding about 100 ft. of wall at the eastern end. The bed of concrete
also, 10 ft. thick, forming the floor of the chamber, was carried
out for 82 ft. at the western end in the open air, and the remainder in
the same movable caisson as used for the south wall. Two sluiceways
on each side running the whole length of the lock, differing 6Â½ ft.
in level, communicate with the lock-chamber through openings in
the side walls, 67Â¼ ft. apart, and provide for the filling and emptying
of the chamber.</p>

<p>The gates closing the entrances and locks at docks are made of
wood or of iron. In iron gates, the heelpost, or a vertical closing strip
attached to the outer side of the gate close to the heelpost,
the meeting-post at the end of each gate closing against
<span class="sidenote">Dock gates.</span>
each other when the gates are shut, and the sill piece fitting
against the sill are generally made of wood. Wooden gates consist of
a series of horizontal framed beams, made thicker and put closer together
towards the bottom to resist the water-pressure increasing with
the depth, fastened to the heelpost and meeting-post at the two ends
and to intermediate uprights, and supporting water-tight planking on
the inner face (fig. 21). Iron gates have generally an outer as well as an
inner skin of iron plates braced vertically and horizontally by plate-iron
ribs, the horizontal ribs being placed nearer together and the
plates made thicker towards the bottom (figs. 22 and 23). Greenheart
is the wood used for gates exposed to salt water, as it resists
the attack of the teredo in temperate climates.
As cellular iron gates are made water-tight, and
have to be ballasted with enough water to
prevent their flotation, or are provided with
air chambers below and are left open to the
rising tide on the outer side above, the gates
are light in the water and are easily moved;
whereas greenheart gates with their fastenings
are considerably heavier than water, so that
a considerable weight has to be moved when
the water is somewhat low in the dock and the
gates therefore only partially immersed. On
the other hand, wooden gates are less liable
than iron gates to be seriously damaged if run
into by a vessel.</p>

<p>Dock gates are sometimes made straight,
closing against a straight sill (figs. 20 and 23);
and occasionally they are made segmental with
the inner faces forming a continuous circular
arc and closing against a sill corresponding to
the outer curves of the gates (fig. 22), or by
means of a projecting sill piece against a
straight sill (fig. 21). More frequently the
gates, curved on both faces, meet at an angle
forming a Gothic arch in plan, and close by
aid of a projecting piece against a straight sill,
which in the Barry entrance gates is modified
by making the outer faces nearly straight
(fig. 19), giving an unusual width to the centre
of the gates. The pressures produced by a
head of water against these gates when closed
depends not only on the form of the gates, but
also upon the projection given to the angle of
the sill in proportion to the width of the lock,
which is known as the rise, and is generally
placed at a distance along the centre line of
the lock, from a line joining the centres of the
heel-posts, of about one-fourth the width. With straight gates, the
stresses consist, first of a transverse stress due to the water-pressure
against the gate, which increases with the head of water and
length of the gate; and secondly, of a compressive stress along
the gate, resulting from the pressure of the other gate against its
meeting-post, which is equal to half the water-pressure on the gate
multiplied by the tangent of half the angle between the closed gates,
varying inversely with the rise. Though an increase in the rise
reduces this stress, it increases the length of the gate and the transverse
stress, and also the length of the lock. By curving the gates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>363</span>
suitably, the transverse stress is reduced and the longitudinal
compressive stress is augmented, till at last, when the gates form a
horizontal segmental arch, the stresses become wholly compressive and
uniform in each horizontal section, increasing with the depth;
and the total stress is equal to the pressure on a unit of surface
multiplied by the radius of curvature. Though the water-pressure is most
uniformly and economically borne by cylindrical gates, they are longer,
and encroach more upon the lines of quay with their curved recesses than
straighter gates; and, consequently, Gothic-arched gates are often
preferred. Straight gates afford the greatest simplicity in construction.</p>

<p>Gates in wide entrances or locks are generally supported towards their
outer end by a roller running along a castiron roller-path on the gate
floor (figs. 19, 21 and 22), as well as by the heelpost, fitted over a
steel pivot at the bottom, and tied back against the hollow quoins at
the top by anchor straps and bolts, on which the gate turns. In some
cases, by placing the water ballast in iron gates close to the heelpost,
a roller has been dispensed with, even, for instance, at the wide
entrance at Havre (fig. 23). The gates are opened and closed, either by
an opening and a closing chain for each gate, fastened on either side
and worked from opposite side walls by hydraulic power, or by a single
hydraulic piston or bar hinged to the inner side of each gate (figs.
19 and 20). The latter system has the advantages of being simpler
and occupying less space in the side walls, of avoiding the slight loss
of available depth over the sill due to the two closing chains crossing
on the sill when the gates are open, and especially of keeping the gates
closed against a swell in exposed sites.</p>

<p>A sliding or rolling caisson is occasionally placed across each end of a
lock in place of a pair of dock gates, being Caissons drawn back into a
recess at the side for opening docks. the lock. As a caisson chamber has
to be covered for over to provide a continuous quay or roadway on the
<span class="sidenote">Caissons for docks.</span>
top, a lowering platform is supplied to enable the caisson to pass under
the small girders spanning the top of the chamber, or the caisson is
sunk down sufficiently (fig. 24). The caisson is furnished with an air
chamber to give it flotation, which is adjusted by ballast according to
the depth of water. The advantages of a caisson, as compared with a pair
of gates, are that the gate recesses, gate floor, hollow quoins and
arrangements for working in the side walls are dispensed with, so that
the lock can be made shorter, and the work at each head is rendered less
complicated. The caisson itself also serves as a very strong movable
bridge, and therefore is often preferred at dockyards to dock gates. By
improvements in the hauling machinery, a caisson can open or close a
lock as quickly as dock gates; the caissons at Zeebrugge lock, at the
entrance to the Bruges ship canal, are drawn across the lock or into
their chamber by electricity in two minutes. A caisson is specially
useful in cases where there may be a head of water on either side, as
then it takes the place of two pairs of gates pointing in opposite
directions, or for closing an entrance against a current. A caisson,
however, requires a much larger amount of material than a pair of dock
gates, and a considerable width on one side for its chamber, so that
under ordinary conditions gates are generally used at docks.</p>

<p>A ship caisson, so called from its presenting some resemblance in
section to the hull of a vessel, occupies too much time in being towed,
floated into position, and sunk into grooves at the bottom and sides of
an entrance for closing it, and then refloated and towed away for
opening the entrance again, to be used at entrances and locks to docks
(fig. 25). Being, however, simple in construction, taking up little
space, and requiring no chamber or machinery for moving it, this form of
caisson is generally used for closing the entrance to a graving dock,
where it remains for several days in place during the execution of
repairs to a vessel in the dock. A ship caisson only requires the
admission of sufficient water to sink it when in position across the
entrance to a graving dock; and this water has to be pumped out before
it can be floated, and removed to some vacant position in the
neighbouring dock till it is again required. Like a sliding or rolling
caisson, it provides a bridge for crossing over the entrance of the
graving dock when in position.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Graving Docks.</i> - Provision has to be made at ports for the repairs of
vessels frequenting them. The simplest arrangement is a timber gridiron,
on which a vessel settles with a falling tide, and can then be inspected
and slightly cleaned and repaired till the tide floats it again.
Inclined slipways are sometimes provided, up which a vessel resting in a
cradle on wheels can be drawn out of the water; and they are also used
for shipbuilding, the vessel when ready for launching being allowed to
slide down them into the water. Graving or dry docks, however, opening
out of a dock, are the usual means provided for enabling the cleaning
and repairs of vessels to be carried out.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A graving dock consists of an enclosure, surrounded by side walls
stepped on the face, and paved at the bottom with a thick floor
sloping slightly down from the centre to drains along the sides, long
enough to receive the longest vessel likely to come to the port. Its
entrance, at the end adjoining the dock, is just wide enough to admit
the vessel of greatest beam, and deep enough over the sill to receive
the vessel of greatest draught, when light, at the lowest water-level of
the dock (figs. 26 and 27). Graving docks are constructed of
masonry, brickwork or concrete, or formerly in America of timber; they
should be founded on a solid impervious stratum, or, where that is
impracticable, they should be built upon bearing piles and enclosed
within sheet piling, to prevent settlement and the infiltration of water
under pressure below the dock. Keel blocks are laid along the centre
line of the dock, for the keel of the vessel to rest on when the water
is pumped out; and the vessel is further supported on each side by
timber shores supported on the steps or &ldquo;altars&rdquo; of the side walls,
which are lined with granite or other hard stone, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>
blue bricks, or, when constructed of concrete, with a facing of stronger
concrete, to enable these altars to withstand the wear and shocks
to which they are subjected. Steps and slides are provided at convenient
places at the sides to give access for men and materials to
the bottom of the dock; and culverts and drains lead the water
to pumps for removing the water from the dock when the entrance
has been closed, and to keep it dry whilst a vessel is under repair.
Culverts in the side walls of the entrance enable water to be admitted
for filling the dock to let the vessel out. Graving docks are generally
closed by ship caissons; but where they open direct on to a tidal
river, and there is some exposure, gates are adopted, or sometimes
sliding caissons.</p>

<p>The dimensions of graving docks vary considerably with the
nature of the trade and the date of construction; and sometimes
an intermediate entrance is provided to accommodate two smaller
vessels. The sizes of some of the largest graving docks are as follows:
Liverpool, Canada dock, 925Â½ ft. long, 94 ft. width of entrance, and
29 ft. depth at the ordinary water-level in the dock; Southampton,
851Â¾ ft. by 90 ft., and 29Â½ ft. depth at high-water neaps (figs. 26 and
27); Tilbury, 875 ft. by 70 ft. by 31Â½ ft.; and Glasgow, 880 ft. by
80 ft. by 26Â½ ft.</p>

<p><i>Floating Dry Docks.</i>&mdash;Where there is no site available for a graving
dock, or the ground is very treacherous, floating dry docks, built
originally of wood, but more recently of iron or steel, have occasionally
been resorted to. The first Bermuda dock towed across the
Atlantic in 1869, and the new dock launched in 1902, 545 ft. by 100 ft.,
are notable examples. Water is admitted into the pontoon at the
bottom to sink the dock sufficiently to admit a vessel at its open end;
and then the water is pumped out of compartments in the pontoon
till the vessel is raised out of water. It is only necessary to find a
sheltered site, with a sufficient depth of water, for conducting the
operations.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DOCKET<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> (perhaps from &ldquo;dock,&rdquo; to curtail or cut short, with
the diminutive suffix <i>et</i>, but the origin of the word is obscure; it
has come into use since the 15th century), in law, a brief summary
or digest of a case, or a memorandum of legal decisions; also
the alphabetical list of cases down for trial, or of suits pending.
Such cases are said to be &ldquo;on the docket.&rdquo; In commercial use, a
docket is a warrant from the custom-house, stating that the duty
on goods entered has been paid, or the label fastened to goods,
showing their destination, value, contents, &amp;c., and, generally,
any indorsement on the back of a document, briefly setting out
its contents.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DOCK WARRANT<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span>, in law, a document by which the owner of a
marine or river dock certifies that the holder is entitled to goods
imported and warehoused in the docks. In the Factors Act 1889
it is included in the phrase &ldquo;document of title&rdquo; and is defined
as any document or writing, being evidence of the title of any
person therein named ... to the property in any goods or
merchandise lying in any warehouse or wharf and signed or
certified by the person having the custody of the goods. It
passes by indorsement and delivery and transfers the absolute
right to the goods described in it. A dock warrant is liable to a
stamp duty of threepence, which may be denoted by an adhesive
stamp, to be cancelled by the person by whom the instrument is
executed or issued.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DOCKYARDS.<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> In the fullest meaning of the word, a &ldquo;dock-yard&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;navy yard&rdquo; in America) is a government establishment
where warships of every kind are built and repaired, and
supplied with the men and stores required to maintain them in
a state of efficiency for war. Thus a dockyard in this extended
sense would include slips for building ships, workshops for
manufacturing their machinery, dry docks for repairing them,
stores of arms, ammunition, coal, provisions, &amp;c., with basins in
which they may lie while being supplied with such things, and an
establishment for providing the <i>personnel</i> necessary for manning
them. But in practice few, if any, existing dockyards are of so
complete a nature; many of them, for instance, do not undertake
the building of ships at all, while others are little more than
harbours where a ship may replenish her stores of coal, water and
provisions and carry out minor repairs. Private firms are relied
upon for the construction of many ships down to an advanced
stage, the government dockyards completing and equipping them
for commission.</p>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i>&mdash;Previous to the reign of Henry VIII., the
kings of England had neither naval arsenals nor dockyards, nor
any regular establishment of civil or naval officers to provide
ships of war, or to man them. There are, however, strong evidences
of the existence of dockyards, or of something answering
thereto, at very early dates, at Rye, Shoreham and Winchelsea.
In November 1243 the sheriff of Sussex was ordered to enlarge
the house at Rye in which the king&rsquo;s galleys were kept, so that it
might contain seven galleys. In 1238 the keepers of some of the
king&rsquo;s galleys were directed to cause those vessels to be breamed,
and a house to be built at Winchelsea for their safe custody. In
1254 the bailiffs of Winchelsea and Rye were ordered to repair
the buildings in which the king&rsquo;s galleys were kept at Rye. At
Portsmouth and at Southampton there seem to have been
at all times depÃ´ts for both ships and stores, though there was
no regular dockyard at Portsmouth till the middle of the 16th
century. It would appear, from a curious poem in Hakluyt&rsquo;s
<i>Collection</i> called &ldquo;The Policie of Keeping the Sea,&rdquo; that Littlehampton,
unfit as it now is, was the port at which Henry VIII.
built</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p style="margin-left:10em;">&ldquo;his great <i>Dromions</i></p>
<p>Which passed other great shippes of the commons.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>The &ldquo;dromion,&rdquo; &ldquo;dromon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dromedary&rdquo; was a large warship,
the prototype of which was furnished by the Saracens.
Roger de Hoveden, Richard of Devizes and Peter de Longtoft
celebrate the struggle which Richard I., in the &ldquo;Trench the Mer,&rdquo;
on his way to Palestine, had with a huge dromon,&mdash;&ldquo;a marvellous
ship! a ship than which, except Noah&rsquo;s ship, none greater was
ever read of.&rdquo; This vessel had three masts, was very high out
of the water, and is said to have had 1500 men on board. It
required the united force of the king&rsquo;s galleys, and an obstinate
fight, to capture the dromon.</p>

<p>The foundation of a regular British navy, by the establishment
of dockyards, and the formation of a board, consisting of certain
commissioners for the management of its affairs, was first laid
by Henry VIII., and the first dockyard erected during his reign
was that of Woolwich. Those of Portsmouth, Deptford, Chatham
and Sheerness followed in succession. Plymouth was founded by
William III. Pembroke was established in 1814, a small yard
having previously existed at Milford.</p>

<p>The most important additions yet made at any one period to
the dockyard and harbour works required to meet the necessities
of the British fleet were those sanctioned by the Naval Works
Acts of 1895 and subsequent years, the total estimated cost, as
stated in the act of 1899, being over 23Â½ millions sterling. The
works proposed under these acts were classified under three heads,
viz. (a) the enclosure and defence of harbours against torpedo
attacks; (b) adapting naval ports to the present needs of the
fleet; (c) naval barracks and hospitals. Under the first heading
were included the defensive harbours at Portland, Dover and
Gibraltar. Under heading (b) were included the deepening of
harbours and approaches, the dockyard extensions at Gibraltar,
Keyham (Devonport), Simons Bay, and Hong-Kong, with
sundry other items. Under heading (c) were included the naval
barracks at Chatham, Portsmouth and Keyham; the naval
hospitals at Chatham, Haslar and Haulbowline; the colleges
at Keyham and Dartmouth; and other items.</p>

<p>Great Britain possesses dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport,
Chatham, Malta and Gibraltar, each in charge of an admiral-superintendent,
and at Sheerness and Pembroke in charge of a
captain-superintendent, together with establishments at Ascension,
Bermuda, Simons Town (Cape of Good Hope), Queenstown
(Haulbowline); Hong-Kong, Portland, Sydney and Weihaiwei.
The Indian Government has dockyards at Bombay and Calcutta.
The medical establishments include Ascension, Bermuda, Cape
of Good Hope, Chatham, Dartmouth, Deal, Gibraltar, Haslar,
Haulbowline, Hong-Kong, Malta, Osborne, Plymouth, Portland,
Portsmouth, Sheerness, Sydney, Yarmouth, Yokohama and
Weihaiwei.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the administrative control of the dockyards
have varied with those adopted for the regulation of the
navy as a whole. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Admiralty Administration</a></span>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Navy</a></span>:
<i>History</i>.) At the present time, whether at home or abroad, they
lie within the province of the controller of the navy (the third lord
of the board of admiralty); and the director of dockyards, whose
office, replacing that of surveyor of dockyards was created in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
December 1885, is responsible to the controller for the building of
ships, boats, &amp;c., in dockyards, and for the maintenance and
repair of ships and boats, and of all steam machinery in ships,
boats, dockyards and factories. The director of naval construction,
who is also deputy-controller, is responsible, not only for
the design of ships, but for their construction, in the sense that he
approves great numbers of working drawings of structural parts
prepared at the dockyards. But the director of dockyards is
the admiralty official under whose instructions the work goes
on, involving the employment and supervision of an army of
artisans and labourers. Instructions, therefore, emanate from
the admiralty, but the details lie with the dockyard officials, and
in practice there is a considerable decentralization of duties.</p>

<p>The chief function of a dockyard is the building and maintaining
of ships in efficiency. The constructive work is carried out
under the care of the chief constructor of the yard, in accordance
with plans sent down from the admiralty. The calculations for
displacement, involving the draught of water forward and aft,
have already been made, and, in order to ensure accuracy in the
carrying out of the design, an admirable system has been devised
for weighing everything that is built into the new ships or that
goes on board; and it is astonishing how very closely the actual
displacement approximates to that which was intended, particularly
when the tendency of weights to increase, in perfecting
a ship for commission, is considered.</p>

<p>The ship having been built to her launching weight, the duty of
putting her into the water devolves upon the chief constructor of
the yard, and failures in this matter are so extremely rare that
it may almost be said they do not occur. As soon as the ship
is water-borne the responsibility falls upon the king&rsquo;s harbour
master, who has charge of her afloat and of moving her into the
fitting basins. When the ship has been brought alongside the
wharf, the responsibility of the chief constructor of the yard
is resumed, and the ship is carried forward to completion by
the affixing of armour plating (if that has not been done before
launching), the mounting of guns, the instalment of engines,
boilers, and electrical and hydraulic gear, and the fitting of cabins
for officers, mess places for men, and storerooms, and a vast
volume of other work unnecessary to be specified. In regard to
the complicated details of guns and torpedoes, the captains of the
gunnery and torpedo schools have a function of supervision. The
captain of the fleet reserve also closely watches the work, because,
when the heads of all departments have reported the ship to be
ready, she has to be inspected by the commander-in-chief at
the port, and then passed into the fleet reserve as ready for sea,
and there the captain of the fleet reserve is responsible for her
efficiency. Other important officers of a dockyard are the chief
engineer; the superintendent civil engineer, who has charge of
the work involved in keeping all buildings, docks, basins, caissons,
roads, &amp;c., in repair; the naval store officer, who has charge of
most of the stores in the dockyard; and the cashier of the yard,
whose name sufficiently expresses his duties.</p>

<p>The system of conducting business at the dockyards is analogous
to that which prevails at the admiralty. There is personal communication
between the officers responsible for the work, and
facilities are afforded for coming to rapid decisions upon matters
that are in hand, and the operations are conducted with an ease
which contributes much to efficiency. In 1844 the custom was
introduced of all the principal officers of the dockyard meeting
at the superintendent&rsquo;s office at 9.30 A.M. every day, to hear the
orders from the admiralty and discuss the work of the day. But
this system of &ldquo;readings&rdquo; was abolished at the beginning of
1906, the naval establishments inquiry committee considering
that the assembling of the officials was unnecessary since the
communications after reception are copied and sent to the
departments concerned.</p>

<p>The police force necessary in a dockyard is in some cases
supplied from the London metropolitan police, and is under
the orders of the superintendent of the yard for duties connected
with it, and under the commissioner of police for the discipline
and disposition of the force. The charges are, of course, paid by
the admiralty, and the system answers well.</p>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;The shore stations under control of the
Navy Department (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Admiralty Administration</a></span>), and
collectively known as naval stations, are under different names
according to their nature. Of those called <i>Navy Yards</i>, and
intended for the general purpose of sources of supply and for
repairs of ships, there are within the United States eight in
number. Two of them are on the Pacific coast, situated on Puget
Sound, at Bremerton, Washington; and at Mare Island, near
San Francisco. The other six are on the Atlantic coast, and
are situated at Portsmouth, N.H.; Boston, Mass.; Brooklyn,
N.Y.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Washington, D.C.; and Norfolk, Va.
There are also naval stations at Port Royal and Charleston, S.C.;
Key West and Pensacola, Fla.; New Orleans, La.; Guantanamo,
Cuba; Culebra and San Juan, Porto Rico; Honolulu,
H.I.; Cavite, P.I.; Tutuila, Samoa; and Island of Guam, in
the Ladrones Islands. The floating dock Dewey, having a lifting
capacity of 18,500 gross tons with a free-board of 2 ft., was
stationed in the Philippine Islands in 1906.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are important naval stations established
for special purposes, which in some cases are also available for
ports of supply and for repairs. These are: the U.S. Naval
Academy, Annapolis, Md., for the instruction of naval cadets;
the training stations at Newport, R.I., and Yerba Buena Island,
Cal., for the instruction of apprentices; the proving ground at
Indian Head, Md., on the Potomac river, where all government-built
ordnance is tested; the War College at Newport, R.I., for
the instruction of officers; the torpedo station at Newport, for
the instruction of officers and men in torpedoes, electricity and
submarine diving; the naval observatory at Washington; and
the marine post at Sitka, Alaska. Coaling depÃ´ts have been
established at Honolulu, Pago Pago, Samoan Islands, and at
Manila, P.I. Naval hospitals are located at the Portsmouth,
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Norfolk and Mare
Island yards; at Las Animas, Colo.; at Newport, R.I.; CaÃ±acao,
P.I.; Sitka, Alaska; and Yokohama, Japan.</p>

<p>The commandant of a navy yard and station, who is usually
a rear-admiral, is its commander-in-chief. His official assistants
are called heads of departments. The captain of the yard, who
is next in succession to command, has general charge of the water
front and the ships moored there, and of the police of the navy
yard; it is his duty to keep the commandant informed as to the
nature and efficiency of all work in progress. The equipment
officer has charge of anchors, chains, rigging, sails and the electric
generating plant. The other heads of departments are the
ordnance officer, the naval constructor, the engineering officer,
the general storekeeper, the paymaster of the yard, the surgeon
and the civil engineer. The clerks and draughtsmen employed
by these officers are appointed under civil service rules, and
their employment is continuous so long as funds are available.
The foremen are selected by competitive examination, and their
number is fixed. In the employment of mechanics and labourers,
veterans are given preference, after which follow persons previously
employed who have displayed especial efficiency and good
conduct. The rates of wages are determined semi-annually by
a board of officers, who ascertain the wages paid by private
establishments in the vicinity of the navy yard. Eight hours
constitute the legal work day. When emergencies necessitate
longer hours the workmen are paid at the ordinary rate plus
50%.</p>

<p>The nature and extent of work to be performed upon naval
vessels is determined by the secretary of the navy; the commandant
then issues the necessary orders. The material required
is obtained by a system of requisitions, which provide for the
purchase from the lowest bidder after open competition. Heads
of departments initiate the purchase of materials which are
peculiar to their own work; ordinary commercial articles,
however, are usually carried in a special stock called the &ldquo;Naval
Supply Fund,&rdquo; which may be drawn upon by any head of department.
All materials are inspected, both as to quantity and
quality, by a board of inspectors consisting of three officers.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>France.</i>&mdash;The French coast is divided into five naval arrondissements,
which have their headquarters at the five naval ports of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
which Cherbourg, Brest and Toulon are the most important, Lorient
and Rochefort being of lesser degree. All are building and fitting-out
yards. Corsica, which has naval stations at Ajaccio, Porto Vecchio,
Bonifacio and other places, is a dependency of the arsenal at Toulon.
On the African coast there are docking facilities in Algeria. Bizerta,
the Tunisian port, has been made a naval base by the deepening
and fortifying of the canal which is the approach to the inner
lake. There are arsenals also at SaÃ¯gon and Hai-phong, and an
establishment at Diego Suarez.</p>

<p>The subsidiary establishments in France are the gun foundry at
Ruelle; the steel and iron works at GuÃ©rigny, where anchors, chains
and armour-plate are made; and the works at Indret, on an island
in the lower Loire, where machinery is constructed. There are
many private shipbuilding establishments in the country, the most
important being the Forges et Chantiers de la MÃ©diterranÃ©e at La
Seyne, on the lesser roadstead at Toulon where many French and
foreign warships of the largest classes have been built. The same
company has a building yard at Havre. Other establishments are
the Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire, at Saint Nazaire; the Normand
Yard, at Havre; and the Chantiers de la Gironde, near Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Each of the arrondissements above mentioned is divided into
sous-arrondissements, having their centres in the great commercial
ports, but this arrangement is purely for the embodiment of the men
of the Inscription Maritime, and has nothing to do with the dockyards
as naval arsenals. In each arrondissement the vice-admiral,
who is naval prefect, is the immediate representative of the minister
of marine, and has full direction and command of the arsenal, which
is his headquarters. He is thus commander-in-chief, as also governor-designate
for time of war, but his authority does not extend to ships
belonging to organized squadrons or divisions. The naval prefect is
assisted by a rear-admiral as chief of the staff (except at Lorient and
Rochefort, where the office is filled by a captain), and a certain number
of officers, the special functions of the chief of the staff having
relation principally to the efficiency and <i>personnel</i> of the fleet, while
the &ldquo;major-general,&rdquo; who is usually a rear-admiral, is concerned
chiefly with the <i>matÃ©riel</i>. There are also directors of stores, of naval
construction, of the medical service and of the submarine defences
(which are concerned with torpedoes, mines and torpedo-boats),
as well as of naval ordnance and works. The prefect directs the
operations of the arsenal, and is responsible for its efficiency and for
that of the ships which are there in reserve. In regard to the constitution
and maintenance of the naval forces, the administration of the
arsenals is divided into three principal departments, the first concerned
with naval construction, the second with ordnance, including
gun-mountings and small-arms, and the third with the so-called
submarine defences, dealing with all torpedo <i>matÃ©riel</i>.</p>

<p><i>Germany.</i>&mdash;With the expansion of the German navy considerable
additions have been made to the two principal dockyards. These
are Wilhelmshaven, the naval headquarters on the North Sea, and
Kiel, the headquarters on the Baltic, Danzig being an establishment
of lesser importance, and Kiao-chau an undeveloped base in the
Shantung peninsula, China. The chief official at each home dockyard
is the superintendent (<i>Oberwerftdirektor</i>), who is a rear-admiral
or senior captain directly responsible to the naval secretary of state.
Under the superintendent&rsquo;s orders are the chief of the AusrÃ¼stung
department, or captain of the fleet reserve, the directors of ordnance,
torpedoes, navigation, naval construction, engineering and harbour
works, with some other officers. The chiefs of the constructive and
engineering departments are responsible for the building of ships and
machinery, and for the maintenance of the hulls and machinery of
existing vessels; while the works department has charge of all work
on the quays, docks, &amp;c., in the dockyard and port. A great advance
has been made in increasing the efficiency and capabilities of the
imperial dockyards by introducing a system of continuous work in
the building of new ships and effecting alterations in others, and
German material is exclusively used. The Schichau Works at
Elbing and Danzig, the Vulkan Yard at Bredow, near Stettin, the
Weser Company at Bremen, and the establishment of Blohm and
Voss at Hamburg, are important establishments which have built
many vessels for the German navy, as well as for foreign states.</p>

<p><i>Italy.</i>&mdash;The principal Italian state dockyards are Spezia, Naples
and Venice, the first named being by far the most important. It
covers an area, including the water spaces, of 629 acres, and there
are five dry docks, three being 433 ft. long and 105 ft. wide, and two
361 ft. long and 98 ft. 6 in. wide. The dockyard is very completely
equipped with machinery of the best British, German and Italian
makes, and it has built several of the finest Italian ships. The
number of hands employed in the yard averages 4000. There are
two building slips, and for smaller vessels there are two in the
neighbouring establishment of San Bartolommeo (which is the headquarters
for submarine mining), and one at San Vito, where is a
Government gun factory. Castellammare di Stabia is subsidiary
to Naples. A large dry dock has been built at Taranto. There is
a small naval establishment at Maddalena Island on the Strait of
Bonifacio. The Italian Government has no gun or torpedo factories,
nearly all the ordnance coming from the Armstrong factory at
Pozzuoli near Naples, and the torpedoes from the Schwarzkopf
factory at Venice, while armour-plates are produced at the important
works at Terni. Machinery is supplied by the firms of
Ansaldo, Odero, Orlando, Guppy &amp; Hawthorn and Pattison. The
three establishments first named have important shipbuilding yards,
and have constructed vessels for the Italian and foreign navies.
The Orlando Yard at Leghorn is Government property, but is
leased by the firm, and possesses five building slips.</p>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i>&mdash;The naval arsenal is on the well-protected
harbour of Pola, in Istria, which is the headquarters of the national
navy, and includes establishments of all kinds for the maintenance
of the fleet. There are large building and docking facilities, and a
number of warships have been built there. There is a construction
yard also at Trieste. A new coaling and torpedo station is at Teodo,
large magazines and stores are at Vallelunga, and the mining establishment
is at Ficella. The shipbuilding branch of the navy is under the
direction of a chief constructor (<i>Oberster-Ingenieur</i>), assisted by seven
constructors, of whom two are of the first class. The engineering and
ordnance branches are similarly organized.</p>

<p><i>Spain.</i>&mdash;The Spanish dockyards are of considerable antiquity, but
of diminishing importance. There is an establishment at Ferrol,
another at Cartagena, and a third at Cadiz. They are well equipped
in all necessary respects, but are not provided with continuous work.
A recent arrangement is the specialization of the yards, Ferrol being
designed for larger, and Carthagena for smaller, building work. The
ordnance establishment is at Carraca.</p>

<p><i>Russia.</i>&mdash;In Russia the naval ports are of two classes. The most
important are Kronstadt, St Petersburg and Nikolayev. Of lesser
importance are Reval, Sveaborg, Sevastopol, Batum, Baku and
Vladivostok. The administration of the larger ports, except St
Petersburg, which is under special regulations, is in the hands of
vice-admirals, who are commanders-in-chief, while the smaller ports
are under the direction of rear-admirals. All are directly under the
minister of marine, except that the Black Sea ports and Astrabad,
on the Caspian, are subordinate to the commander-in-chief at
Nikolayev. Sevastopol has grown in importance, and become
mainly a naval harbour, the commercial harbour being removed to
Theodosia. The Russian government has also proposed to remodel
the harbour works at St Petersburg and Kronstadt. The Emperor
Alexander III. Port at Libau, on the Baltic, is in a region less liable
to be icebound in the winter. There are no strictly private yards for
the building of large vessels in Russia, except that of the Black Sea
Company at Nikolayev. Messrs Creighton build torpedo-boats at
Ã…bo in Finland, and the admiralty has steel works at Ijora, where
some torpedo-boats have been built. Other ordnance and steel
works are at Obukhov and Putilov.</p>

<p><i>Japan.</i>&mdash;The principal Japanese dockyard, which was established
by the Shogunate in 1866, is Yokosuka. French naval constructors
and engineers were employed, and several wooden ships were built.
The Japanese took the administration into their own hands in 1875,
and built a number of vessels of small displacement in the yard.
The limit of size was about 5000 tons, but the establishment has been
enlarged so that vessels of the first class may be built there. There
is a first-class modern dry dock which will take the largest battleship.
Shipbuilding would be undertaken to a larger extent but for the fact
that nearly all material has to come from abroad. Down to 1905
all the important vessels of the Japanese navy were built in Great
Britain, France, Germany and the United States, but at the end of
that year a first-class cruiser of 13,500 tons (the &ldquo;Tsukuba&rdquo;) was
launched from the important yard at Kure. There are other yards
at Sassebo and Maisuru.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DOCTOR<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> (Lat. for &ldquo;teacher&rdquo;), the title conferred by the
highest university degree. Originally there were only two
degrees, those of bachelor and master, and the title doctor was
given to certain masters as a merely honorary appellation.
The process by which it became established as a degree superior
to that of master cannot be clearly traced. At Bologna it seems
to have been conferred in the faculty of law as early as the
12th century. Paris conferred the degree in the faculty of
divinity, according to Antony Wood, some time after 1150. In
England it was introduced in the 13th century; and both in
England and on the continent it was long confined to the faculties
of law and divinity. Though the word is so commonly used as
synonymous with &ldquo;physician,&rdquo; it was not until the 14th century
that the doctor&rsquo;s degree began to be conferred in medicine. The
tendency since has been to extend it to all faculties; thus in
Germany, in the faculty of arts, it has replaced the old title of
<i>magister</i>. The doctorate of music was first conferred at Oxford
and Cambridge.</p>

<p><i>Doctors of the Church</i> are certain saints whose doctrinal writings
have obtained, by the universal consent of the Church
or by papal decree, a special authority. In the case of the great
schoolmen a characteristic qualification was added to the title
doctor, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;angelicus&rdquo; (Aquinas), &ldquo;mellifluus&rdquo; (Bernard).
The doctors of the Church are: for the East, SS. Athanasius,
Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil the Great, John Chrysostom; for
the West, SS. Hilary, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, Gregory the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
Great, Anselm, Bernard, Bonaventura and Thomas Aquinas.
To these St Alphonso dei Liguori was added by Pope Pius IX.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DOCTORS&rsquo; COMMONS,<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> the name formerly applied to a
society of ecclesiastical lawyers in London, forming a distinct
profession for the practice of the civil and canon laws. Some
members of the profession purchased in 1567 a site near St Paul&rsquo;s,
on which at their own expense they erected houses (destroyed in
the great fire, but rebuilt in 1672) for the residence of the judges
and advocates, and proper buildings for holding the ecclesiastical
and admiralty courts. In 1768 a royal charter was obtained
by virtue of which the then members of the society and their
successors were incorporated under the name and title of &ldquo;The
College of Doctors of Law exercent in the Ecclesiastical and
Admiralty Courts.&rdquo; The college consisted of a president (the
dean of Arches for the time being) and of those doctors of law
who, having regularly taken that degree in either of the universities
of Oxford or Cambridge, and having been admitted
advocates in pursuance of the rescript of the archbishop of
Canterbury, were elected fellows in the manner prescribed by
the charter. There were also attached to the college thirty-four
proctors, whose duties were analogous to those of solicitors.
The judges of the archiepiscopal courts were always selected
from this college. By the Court of Probate Act 1857 the
college was empowered to sell its real and personal estate and
to surrender its charter, and it was enacted that on such
surrender the college should be dissolved and the property
thereof belong to the then existing members as tenants in
common for their own use and benefit. The college was accordingly

<p><span class="bold">DOCTRINAIRES,<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> the name given to the leaders of the moderate
and constitutional Royalists in France after the second restoration
of Louis XVIII. in 1815. The name, as has often been the
case with party designations, was at first given in derision, and
by an enemy. In 1816 the <i>Nain jaune rÃ©fugiÃ©</i>, a French paper
published at Brussels by Bonapartist and Liberal exiles, began
to speak of M. Royer-Collard as the &ldquo;doctrinaire&rdquo; and also as
<i>le pÃ¨re Royer-Collard de la doctrine chrÃ©tienne</i>. The <i>pÃ¨res de la
doctrine chrÃ©tienne</i>, popularly known as the &ldquo;doctrinaires,&rdquo; were
a French religious order founded in 1592 by CÃ©sar de Bus. The
choice of a nickname for M. Royer-Collard does credit to the
journalistic insight of the contributors to the <i>Nain jaune rÃ©fugiÃ©</i>,
for he was emphatically a man who made it his business to preach
a doctrine and an orthodoxy. The popularity of the name and
its rapid extension to M. Royer-Collard&rsquo;s colleagues is the sufficient
proof that it was well chosen and had more than a personal
application. These colleagues came, it is true, from various
quarters. The duc de Richelieu and M. de Serre had been Royalist
<i>Ã©migrÃ©s</i> during the revolutionary and imperial epoch. MM.
Royer-Collard himself, LainÃ©, and Maine de Biran had sat in the
revolutionary Assemblies. MM. Pasquier, Beugnot, de Barante,
Cuvier, Mounier, Guizot and Decazes had been imperial officials.
But they were closely united by political principle, and also by a
certain similarity of method. Some of them, notably Guizot and
Maine de Biran, were theorists and commentators on the principles
of government. M. de Barante was an eminent man of letters.
All were noted for the doctrinal coherence of their principles and
the dialectical rigidity of their arguments. The object of the
party as defined by M. (afterwards the duc) Decazes was to
&ldquo;nationalize the monarchy and to royalize France.&rdquo; The means
by which they hoped to attain this end were a loyal application
of the charter granted by Louis XVIII., and the steady co-operation
of the king with the moderate Royalists to defeat the
extreme party known as the Ultras, who aimed at the complete
undoing of the political and social work of the Revolution. The
Doctrinaires were ready to allow the king a large discretion in
the choice of his ministers and the direction of national policy.
They refused to allow that ministers should be removed in
obedience to a hostile vote in the chamber. Their ideal in fact
was a combination of a king who frankly accepted the results
of the Revolution, and who governed in a liberal spirit, with the
advice of a chamber elected by a very limited constituency, in
which men of property and education formed, if not the whole,
at least the very great majority of the voters. Their views were
set forth by Guizot in 1816 in his treatise <i>Du gouvernement
reprÃ©sentatif et de l&rsquo;Ã©tat actuel de la France.</i> The chief organs of
the party in the press were the <i>IndÃ©pendent</i>, renamed the <i>Constitutionnel</i>
in 1817, and the <i>Journal des dÃ©bats</i>. The supporters
of the Doctrinaires in the country were chiefly ex-officials of the
empire,&mdash;who believed in the necessity for monarchical government
but had a lively memory of Napoleon&rsquo;s tyranny and a
no less lively hatred of the <i>ancien rÃ©gime</i>&mdash;merchants, manufacturers
and members of the liberal professions, particularly the
lawyers. The history of the Doctrinaires as a separate political
party began in 1816 and ended in 1830. In 1816 they obtained
the co-operation of Louis XVIII., who had been frightened by
the violence of the Ultras in the <i>Chambre introuvable</i> of 1815.
In 1830 they were destroyed by Charles X. when he took the
Ultra prince de Polignac as his minister and entered on the conflict
with Liberalism in France which ended in his overthrow.
During the revolution of 1830 the Doctrinaires became absorbed
in the Orleanists, from whom they had never been separated on
any ground of principle (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>: <i>History</i>).</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;doctrinaire&rdquo; has become naturalized in English
terminology, as applied, in a slightly contemptuous sense, to a
theorist, as distinguished from a practical man of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DODD, WILLIAM<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> (1729-1777), English divine, was born at
Bourne in Lincolnshire in May 1729. He was admitted a sizar
of Clare Hall, Cambridge, in 1745, and took the degree of B.A.
in 1750, being fifteenth wrangler. On leaving the university he
married a young woman of a more than questionable reputation,
whose extravagant habits helped to ruin him. In 1751 he
was ordained deacon, and in 1753 priest, and he soon became a
popular and celebrated preacher. His first preferment was the
lectureship of West-Ham and Bow. In 1754 he was also chosen
lecturer of St Olave&rsquo;s, Hart Street; and in 1757 he took the
degree of M.A. at Cambridge, subsequently becoming LL.D.
He was a strenuous supporter of the Magdalen hospital, founded
in 1758, and soon afterwards became preacher at the chapel of
that charity. In 1763 he obtained a prebend at Brecon, and in
the same year he was appointed one of the king&rsquo;s chaplains,&mdash;soon
after which the education of Philip Stanhope, afterwards
earl of Chesterfield, was committed to his care. In 1768 he had
a fashionable congregation and was held in high esteem, but
indiscreet ambition led to his ruin. On the living of St George&rsquo;s,
Hanover Square, becoming vacant in 1774, Mrs Dodd wrote
an anonymous letter to the wife of the lord chancellor, offering
three thousand guineas if, by her assistance, Dodd were promoted
to the benefice. This letter having been traced, a complaint was
immediately made to the king, and Dodd was dismissed from his
office as chaplain. After residing for some time at Geneva and
Paris, he returned to England in 1776. He still continued to
exercise his clerical functions, but his extravagant habits soon
involved him in difficulties. To meet his creditors he forged
a bond on his former pupil Lord Chesterfield for Â£4200, and
actually received the money. He was detected, committed to
prison, tried at the Old Bailey, found guilty, and sentenced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
death; and, in spite of numerous applications for mercy, he was
executed at Tyburn on the 27th of June 1777. Samuel Johnson
was very zealous in pleading for a pardon, and a petition from
the city of London received 23,000 signatures. Dr Dodd was a
voluminous writer and possessed considerable abilities, with but
little judgment and much vanity. He wrote one or two comedies,
and his <i>Beauties of Shakespeare</i>, published in 1752, was long a
well-known work; while his <i>Thoughts in Prison</i>, a poem in blank
verse, written between his conviction and execution, naturally
attracted much attention. He published a large number of
sermons and other theological works, including a <i>Commentary
on the Bible</i> (1765-1770). A list of his fifty-five writings and an
account of the writer is included in the <i>Thoughts in Prison</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DODDER<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> (Frisian <i>dodd</i>, a bunch; Dutch <i>dot</i>, ravelled thread),
the popular name of the annual, leafless, twining, parasitic plants
forming the genus
<i>Cuscuta</i>, formerly
regarded as representing
a distinct
natural order
Cuscutaceae, but
now generally
ranked as a tribe
of the natural
order Convolvulaceae.
The genus
contains nearly
100 species and is
widely distributed
in the temperate
and warmer parts
of the earth. The
slender thread-like
stem is white,
yellow, or red in
colour, bears no
leaves, and attaches
itself by
suckers to the stem
or leaves of some
other plant round
which it twines
and from which it
derives its nourishment.
It bears
clusters of small
flowers with a
four- or five-toothed
calyx, a
cup-shaped corolla
with four or five
stamens inserted
on its tube, and
sometimes a ring
of scales below the
stamens; the two-celled
ovary becomes when ripe a capsule splitting by a ring
just above the base. The seeds are angular and contain a
thread-like spirally coiled embryo which bears no cotyledons.
On coming in contact with the living stem of some other plant
the seedling dodder throws out a sucker, by which it attaches
itself and begins to absorb the sap of its foster-parent; it then
soon ceases to have any connexion with the ground. As it
grows, it throws out fresh suckers, establishing itself firmly on
the host-plant (fig. 2). After making a few turns round one stem
the dodder finds its way to another, and thus it continues twining
and branching till it resembles &ldquo;fine, closely-tangled, wet catgut.&rdquo;
The injury done to flax, clover, hop and bean crops by
species of dodder is often very great. <i>C. europaea</i>, the greater
dodder (fig. 1) is found parasitic on nettles, thistles, vetches and
the hop; <i>C. Epilinum</i>, on flax; <i>C. Epithymum</i>, on furze, ling
and thyme. <i>C. Trifolii</i>, the Clover Dodder, is perhaps a subspecies
of the last mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DODDRIDGE, PHILIP<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> (1702-1751), English Nonconformist
divine, was born in London on the 26th of June 1702. His
father, Daniel Doddridge, was a London merchant, and his
mother the orphan daughter of the Rev. John Bauman, a
Lutheran clergyman who had fled from Prague to escape religious
persecution, and had held for some time the mastership of the
grammar school at Kingston-upon-Thames. Before he could
read, his mother taught him the history of the Old and New
Testament by the assistance of some blue Dutch chimney-tiles.
He afterwards went to a private school in London, and in 1712
to the grammar school
at Kingston-upon-Thames.
About 1715
he was removed to a
private school at St
Albans, where he was
much influenced by the
Presbyterian minister,
Samuel Clarke. He declined
offers which would
have led him into the
Anglican ministry or the
bar, and in 1719 entered
the very liberal academy
for dissenters at Kibworth
in Leicestershire,
taught at that time by
the Rev. John Jennings,
whom Doddridge succeeded
in the ministry
at that place in 1723,
declining overtures from
Coventry, Pershore and
London (Haberdashers&rsquo;
Hall). In 1729, at a
general meeting of Nonconformist
ministers, he was chosen to conduct the academy
established in that year at Market Harborough. In the same
year he received an invitation from the independent congregation
at Northampton, which he accepted. Here he continued
his multifarious labours; but the church seems to have decreased,
and his many engagements and bulky correspondence
interfered seriously with his pulpit work, and with the discipline
of his academy, where he had some 200 students to whom he
lectured on philosophy and theology in the mathematical or
Spinozistic style. In 1751 his health, which had never been
good, broke down, and he sailed for Lisbon on the 30th of
September of that year; but the change was unavailing, and
he died there on the 26th of October. His popularity as a
preacher is said to have been chiefly due to his &ldquo;high susceptibility,
joined with physical advantages and perfect sincerity.&rdquo;
His sermons were mostly practical in character, and his great
aim was to cultivate in his hearers a spiritual and devotional
frame of mind. He laboured for the attainment of a united
Nonconformist body, which should retain the cultured element
without alienating the uneducated. His principal works are,
<i>The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul</i> (1745), which best
illustrates his religious genius, and has been widely translated;
<i>The Family Expositor</i> (6 vols., 1739-1756), <i>Life of Colonel
Gardiner</i> (1747); and a <i>Course of Lectures on Pneumatology,
Ethics and Divinity</i> (1763). He also published several courses
of sermons on particular topics, and is the author of many well-known
and justly admired hymns, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;O God of Bethel, by
whose hand.&rdquo; In 1736 both the universities at Aberdeen gave
him the degree of D.D.</p>

(1829). The best life is Stanford&rsquo;s <i>Philip Doddridge</i> (1880). Doddridge&rsquo;s

father&rsquo;s family was of Anglo-French origin. He was educated at
Carcassonne and at St Cyr, and in 1864 joined the marine infantry
as a sub-lieutenant. He was promoted captain for his services
during the disturbances in RÃ©union in 1868-69, in the course
of which he was wounded. He served as a company commander
in the Franco-German War, was taken prisoner at Sedan but
escaped, and took part in the campaigns of the Loire and of the
East. In 1872 he was sent to West Africa, and, except when on
active service in Cochin China (1878) and Tong-King (1883), he
remained on duty in Senegal for the next twenty years, taking
a prominent part in the operations which brought the countries
of the Upper Senegal and Upper Niger under French rule. He
led the expeditions against the Boal and Kayor (1889), the
Serreres (1890) and the Futa (1891), and from 1888 to 1891 was
colonel commanding the troops in Senegal. At the close of 1891
he returned to France to command the eighth marine infantry
at Toulon. In April 1892 Dodds was selected to command the
expeditionary force in Dahomey; he occupied Abomey, the
hostile capital, in November, and in a second campaign (1894)
he completed the subjugation of the country. He was then
appointed inspector-general of the marine infantry, and after a
tour of the French colonies was given the command of the XX.
(Colonial) Army Corps, subsequently becoming inspector-general
of colonial troops and a member of the <i>Conseil supÃ©rieur de

of December 1791. His father, Johann Christoph DÃ¶derlein,
professor of theology at Jena, was celebrated for his varied
learning, for his eloquence as a preacher, and for the important
influence he exerted in guiding the transition movement
from strict orthodoxy to a freer theology. Ludwig DÃ¶derlein,
after receiving his preliminary education at Windsheim and
Schulpforta (Pforta), studied at Munich, Heidelberg, Erlangen
and Berlin. He devoted his chief attention to philology under the
instruction of such men as F. Thiersch, G. F. Creuzer, J. H. Voss,
F. A. Wolf, August BÃ¶ckh and P. K. Buttmann. In 1815, soon
after completing his studies at Berlin, he accepted the appointment
of ordinary professor of philology in the academy of Bern.
In 1819 he was transferred to Erlangen, where he became second
professor of philology in the university and rector of the
gymnasium. In 1827 he became first professor of philology and
rhetoric and director of the philological seminary. He died on
the 9th of November 1863. DÃ¶derlein&rsquo;s most elaborate work as a
philologist was marred by over-subtlety, and lacked method
and clearness. He is best known by his <i>Lateinische Synonymen
und Etymologien</i> (1826-1838), and his <i>Homerisches Glossarium</i>
(1850-1858). To the same class belong his <i>Lateinische Wortbildung</i>
(1838), <i>Handbuch der lateinischen Synonymik</i> (1839),
and the <i>Handbuch der lateinischen Etymologie</i> (1841), besides
various works of a more elementary kind intended for the use
of schools and gymnasia. Most of the works named have been
translated into English. To critical philology DÃ¶derlein contributed
valuable editions of Tacitus (<i>Opera</i>, 1847; <i>Germania</i>,
with a German translation) and Horace (<i>Epistolae</i>, with a German
translation, 1856-1858; <i>Satirae</i>, 1860). His <i>Reden und AufsÃ¤tze</i>
(Erlangen, 1843-1847) and <i>Offentliche Reden</i> (1860) consist

<p><span class="bold">DODGSON, CHARLES LUTWIDGE<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> [<span class="sc">&rdquo;Lewis Carroll&rdquo;</span>]
(1832-1898), English mathematician and author, son of the Rev.
Charles Dodgson, vicar of Daresbury, Cheshire, was born in that
village on the 27th of January 1832. The literary life of &ldquo;Lewis
Carroll&rdquo; became familiar to a wide circle of readers, but the
private life of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was retired and practically
uneventful. After four years&rsquo; schooling at Rugby, Dodgson
matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in May 1850; and from
1852 till 1870 held a studentship there. He took a first class in
the final mathematical school in 1854, and the following year was
appointed mathematical lecturer at Christ Church, a post he
continued to fill till 1881. In 1861 he was ordained deacon, but
he never took priest&rsquo;s orders, possibly because of a stammer which
prevented reading aloud. His earliest publications, beginning
with <i>A Syllabus of Plane Algebraical Geometry</i> (1860) and <i>The
Formulae of Plane Trigonometry</i> (1861), were exclusively mathematical;
but late in the year 1865 he published, under the
pseudonym of &ldquo;Lewis Carroll,&rdquo; <i>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</i>,
a work that was the outcome of his keen sympathy with the
imagination of children and their sense of fun. Its success was
immediate, and the name of &ldquo;Lewis Carroll&rdquo; has ever since been
a household word. A dramatic version of the &ldquo;Alice&rdquo; books by
Mr Savile Clarke was produced at Christmas, 1886, and has since
enjoyed many revivals. Mr Dodgson was always very fond of
children, and it was an open secret that the original of &ldquo;Alice&rdquo;
was a daughter of Dean Liddell. <i>Alice</i> was followed (in the
&ldquo;Lewis Carroll&rdquo; series) by <i>Phantasmagoria</i>, in 1869; <i>Through
the Looking-Glass</i>, in 1871; <i>The Hunting of the Snark</i> (1876);
<i>Rhyme and Reason</i> (1883); <i>A Tangled Tale</i> (1885); and
<i>Sylvie and Bruno</i> (in two parts, 1889 and 1893). He wrote skits
on Oxford subjects from time to time. <i>The Dynamics of a
Particle</i> was written on the occasion of the contest between
Gladstone and Mr Gathorne Hardy (afterwards earl of
Cranbrook); and <i>The New Belfry</i> in ridicule of the erection put
up at Christ Church for the bells that were removed from the
Cathedral tower. While &ldquo;Lewis Carroll&rdquo; was delighting
children of all ages, C. L. Dodgson periodically published mathematical
works&mdash;<i>An Elementary Treatise on Determinants</i> (1867);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
<i>Euclid, Book V., proved Algebraically</i> (1874); <i>Euclid and his
Modern Rivals</i> (1879), the work on which his reputation as a
mathematician largely rests; and <i>Curiosa Mathematica</i> (1888).
Throughout this dual existence Mr Dodgson pertinaciously
refused to acquiesce in being publicly identified with &ldquo;Lewis
Carroll.&rdquo; Though the fact of his authorship of the &ldquo;Alice&rdquo;
books was well known, he invariably stated, when occasion called
for such a pronouncement, that &ldquo;Mr Dodgson neither claimed nor
acknowledged any connexion with the books not published under

Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London, which was endowed

<p><span class="bold">DODO<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> (from the Portuguese <i>DÃ³udo</i>, a simpleton), a large bird
formerly inhabiting the island of Mauritius, but now extinct&mdash;the
<i>Didus ineptus</i> of Linnaeus. When, in 1507, the Portuguese
discovered the island which we now know as Mauritius they named
it <i>Ilha do CernÃ©</i>, from a notion that it must be the island of that
name mentioned by Pliny; but most authors have insisted that
it was known to the seamen of that nation as <i>Ilha do Cisne</i>&mdash;perhaps
but a corruption of Cerne, and brought about by their
finding it stocked with large fowls, which, though not aquatic,
they likened to swans, the most familiar to them of bulky birds.
In 1598 the Dutch, under Van Neck, took possession of the island
and renamed it Mauritius. A narrative of this voyage was
published, in 1601, if not earlier, and has been often reprinted.
Here we have birds spoken of as big as swans or bigger, with large
heads, no wings, and a tail consisting of a few curly feathers. The
Dutch called them <i>WalgvÃ¶gels</i> (the word is variously spelled), <i>i.e.</i>
nauseous birds, either because no cooking made them palatable,
or because this island-paradise afforded an abundance of fare so
much superior. De Bry gives two admirably quaint prints of
the doings of the Hollanders, and in one of them the <i>WalgvÃ¶gel</i>
appears, being the earliest published representation of its unwieldy
form, with a footnote stating that the voyagers brought
an example alive to Holland. Among the company there was a
draughtsman, and from a sketch of his, Clusius, a few years after,
gave a figure of the bird, which he vaguely called &ldquo;<i>Gallinaceus
Gallus peregrinus</i>,&rdquo; but described rather fully. Meanwhile two
other Dutch fleets had visited Mauritius. One of them had rather
an accomplished artist on board, and his drawings fortunately still
exist (see article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bird</a></span>). Of the other a journal kept by one of
the skippers was subsequently published. This in the main
corroborates what has been before said of the birds, but adds the
curious fact that they were now called by some <i>Dodaarsen</i> and by
others <i>Dronten</i>.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>Henceforth Dutch narrators, though several times mentioning
the bird, fail to supply any important fact in its history. Their
navigators, however, were not idle, and found work for their
naturalists and painters. Clusius says that in 1605 he saw at
Pauw&rsquo;s House in Leyden a dodo&rsquo;s foot,<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a> which he minutely
describes. In a copy of Clusius&rsquo;s work in the high school of
Utrecht is pasted an original drawing by Van de Venne superscribed
&ldquo;Vera effigies huius avis <i>WalghvÃ¶gel</i> (quae &amp; a nautis
<i>Dodaers</i> propter foedam posterioris partis crassitiem nuncupatur),
qualis viua Amsterodamum perlata est ex insula Mauritii. Anno
M.DC.XXVI.&rdquo; Now a good many paintings of the dodo drawn
from life by Roelandt Savery (1576-1639) exist; and the paintings
by him at Berlin and Vienna&mdash;dated 1626 and 1628&mdash;as
well as the picture by Goiemare, belonging to the duke of
Northumberland, dated 1627, may be with greater plausibility
than ever considered portraits of a captive bird. It is even
probable that this was not the first example painted in Europe.
In the private library of the emperor Francis I. of Austria was a
series of pictures of various animals, supposed to be by the Dutch
artist Hoefnagel, who was born about 1545. One of these
represents a dodo, and, if there be no mistake in Von Frauenfeld&rsquo;s
ascription, it must almost certainly have been painted before
1626, while there is reason to think that the original may have
been kept in the <i>vivarium</i> of the emperor Rudolf II., and that the
portion of a dodo&rsquo;s head, which was found in the museum at
Prague about 1850, belonged to this example. The other pictures
by Roelandt Savery, like those in the possession of the Zoological
Society of London and others, are undated, but were probably all
painted about the same time&mdash;1626-1628. The large picture in
the British Museum, once belonging to Sir Hans Sloane, by an
unknown artist, but supposed to be by Roelandt Savery, is also
undated; while the still larger one at Oxford (considered to be by
the younger Savery) bears a much later date, 1651. Undated also
is a picture in Holland said to be by Pieter Holsteyn.</p>

<p>In 1628 we have the evidence of the first English observer of
the bird&mdash;one Emanuel Altham, who mentions it in two letters
written on the same day from Mauritius to his brother at home
(<i>Proc. Zool. Soc.</i> 1874, pp. 447-449). In one he says: &ldquo;You
shall receue ... a strange fowle: which I had at the Iland
Mauritius called by ye portingalls a Do Do: which for the rareness
thereof I hope wilbe welcome to you.&rdquo; The passage in the
other letter is to the same effect, with the addition of the words
&ldquo;if it liue.&rdquo; In the same fleet with Altham sailed Sir Thomas
Herbert, whose <i>Travels</i> ran through several editions. It is plain
that he could not have reached Mauritius till 1629, though 1627
has been usually assigned as the date of his visit. The fullest
account he gives of the bird is in his edition of 1638: &ldquo;The Dodo
comes first to a description: here, and in <i>Dygarrois</i><a name="fa3m" id="fa3m" href="#ft3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a> (and no
where else, that ever I could see or heare of) is generated the Dodo
(a Portuguize name it is, and has reference to her simpleness,) a
Bird which for shape and rareness might be call&rsquo;d a Phoenix
(wer&rsquo;t in Arabia:)&rdquo; &amp;c. Herbert was weak as an etymologist,
but his positive statement, corroborated as it is by Altham,
cannot be set aside, and hence we do not hesitate to assign a
Portuguese derivation for the word.<a name="fa4m" id="fa4m" href="#ft4m"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Herbert also gave a figure
of the bird.</p>

<p>Proceeding chronologically we next come upon a curious bit
of evidence. This is contained in a MS. diary kept between 1626
and 1640, by Thomas Crossfield of Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, where,
under the year 1634, mention is casually made of one Mr Gosling
&ldquo;who bestowed the Dodar (a blacke Indian bird) vpon ye
Anatomy school.&rdquo; Nothing more is known of it. About 1638,
Sir Hamon Lestrange tells us, as he walked London streets he saw
the picture of a strange fowl hung out on a cloth canvas, and
going in to see it found a great bird kept in a chamber &ldquo;somewhat
bigger than the largest Turky cock, and so legged and footed, but
shorter and thicker.&rdquo; The keeper called it a dodo and showed
the visitors how his captive would swallow &ldquo;large peble stones
... as bigge as nutmegs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1651 Morisot published an account of a voyage made by
FranÃ§ois Cauche, who professed to have passed fifteen days in
Mauritius, or &ldquo;l&rsquo;isle de Saincte Apollonie,&rdquo; as he called it, in
1638. According to De Flacourt the narrative is not very
trustworthy, and indeed certain statements are obviously
inaccurate. Cauche says he saw there birds bigger than swans,
which he describes so as to leave no doubt of his meaning dodos;
but perhaps the most important facts (if they be facts) that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
relates are that they had a cry like a gosling (&ldquo;il a un cry comme
l&rsquo;oison&rdquo;), and that they laid a single white egg (&ldquo;gros comme un
pain d&rsquo;un sol&rdquo;) on a mass of grass in the forests. He calls them
&ldquo;oiseaux de Nazaret,&rdquo; perhaps, as a marginal note informs us,
from an island of that name which was then supposed to lie more
to the northward, but is now known to have no existence.</p>

<p>In the catalogue of Tradescant&rsquo;s <i>Collection of Rarities, preserved
at South Lambeth</i>, published in 1656, we have entered among the
&ldquo;Whole Birds,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Dodar from the island <i>Mauritius</i>; it is not
able to flie being so big.&rdquo; This specimen may well have been the
skin of the bird seen by Lestrange some eighteen years before, but
anyhow we are able to trace the specimen through Willughby,
Edward Llwyd and Thomas Hyde, till it passed in or before 1684
to the Ashmolean collection at Oxford. In 1755 it was ordered
to be destroyed, but, in accordance with the original orders of
Ashmole, its head and right foot were preserved, and still ornament
the museum of that university. In the second edition of a
<i>Catalogue of many Natural Rarities</i>, &amp;c., &ldquo;to be seen at the place
formerly called the Music House, near the West End of St Paul&rsquo;s
Church,&rdquo; collected by one Hubert <i>alias</i> Forbes, and published in
1665, mention is made of a &ldquo;legge of a Dodo, a great heavy bird
that cannot fly; it is a Bird of the Mauricius Island.&rdquo; This is
supposed to have subsequently passed into the possession of the
Royal Society. At all events such a specimen is included in
Grew&rsquo;s list of their treasures which was published in 1681. This
was afterwards transferred to the British Museum. It is a left
foot, without the integuments, but it differs sufficiently in size
from the Oxford specimen to forbid its having been part of the
same individual. In 1666 Olearius brought out the <i>Gottorffische
Kunst Kammer</i>, wherein he describes the head of a <i>WalghvÃ¶gel</i>
which some sixty years later was removed to the museum at
Copenhagen, and is now preserved there, having been the means
of first leading zoologists, under the guidance of Prof. J. Th.
Reinhardt, to recognize the true affinities of the bird.</p>

<p>We have passed over all but the principal narratives of voyagers
or other notices of the bird. A compendious bibliography, up to
the year 1848, will be found in Strickland&rsquo;s classical work,<a name="fa5m" id="fa5m" href="#ft5m"><span class="sp">5</span></a> and
the list was continued by Von Frauenfeld<a name="fa6m" id="fa6m" href="#ft6m"><span class="sp">6</span></a> for twenty years later.
The last evidence we have of the dodo&rsquo;s existence is furnished by a
journal kept by Benj. Harry, and now in the British Museum
(<i>MSS. Addit. 3668.</i> II. D). This shows its survival till 1681, but
the writer&rsquo;s sole remark upon it is that its &ldquo;fflesh is very hard.&rdquo;
The successive occupation of the island by different masters
seems to have destroyed every tradition relating to the bird, and
doubts began to arise whether such a creature had ever existed.
Dr Henry Duncan, Scottish minister and journalist, in 1828,
showed how ill-founded these doubts were, and some ten years
later William John Broderip with much diligence collected all the
available evidence into an admirable essay, which in its turn was
succeeded by Strickland&rsquo;s monograph just mentioned. But in
the meanwhile little was done towards obtaining any material
advance in our knowledge, Prof. Reinhardt&rsquo;s determination of its
affinity to the pigeons (<i>Columbae</i>) excepted; and it was hardly
until George Clark&rsquo;s discovery in 1865 of a large number of dodos&rsquo;
remains in the mud of a pool (the Mare aux Songes) that zoologists
generally were prepared to accept that affinity without question.
The examination of bone after bone by Sir R. Owen (<i>Trans.
Zool. Soc.</i> vi. p. 49) confirmed the judgment of the Danish
naturalist.</p>

<p>In 1889 Th. Sauzier, acting for the government of Mauritius,
sent a great number of bones from the same swamp to Sir Edward
Newton.<a name="fa7m" id="fa7m" href="#ft7m"><span class="sp">7</span></a> From these the first correctly restored and properly
mounted skeleton was prepared and sent to Paris, to be forwarded
to the museum of Mauritius. Good specimens are in the British
Museum, at Paris and at Cambridge, England.</p>

<p>The huge blackish bill of the dodo terminated in a large, horny
hook; the cheeks were partly bare, the stout, short legs yellow.
The plumage was dark
ash-coloured, with
whitish breast and
tail, yellowish white
wings (incapable of
flight). The short tail
formed a curly tuft.</p>

<p>The dodo is said to
have inhabited forests
and to have laid one
large white egg on a
mass of grass. Besides
man, hogs and other
imported animals
seem to have exterminated
it. But the
dodo is not the only
member of its family
that has vanished.
The little island which
has successively borne
the name of Mascaregnas,
England&rsquo;s
Forest, Bourbon and
RÃ©union, and lies to
the southward of
Mauritius, had also an
allied bird, now dead
and gone. Of this not
a relic has been
handled by any naturalist.
The latest description
of it, by Du
Bois in 1674, is very
meagre, while Bontekoe (1646) gave a figure, apparently intended
to represent it. It was originally called the &ldquo;solitaire,&rdquo; but this
name was also applied to <i>Pezophaps solitarius</i> of Rodriguez by
the Huguenot exile Leguat, who described and figured it about
1691.</p>

<p>The solitaire, Didus solitarius of Gmelin, referred by Strickland
to a district genus Pezophaps, is supposed to have lingered in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
island of Rodriguez until about 1761. Leguat<a name="fa8m" id="fa8m" href="#ft8m"><span class="sp">8</span></a> has given a
delightful description of its quaint habits. The male stood about
2 ft. 9 in. high; its colour was brownish grey, that of its mate
more inclined to brown, with a whitish breast. The wings were
rudimentary, the tail very small, almost hidden, and the thigh
feathers were thick and curled &ldquo;like shells.&rdquo; A round mass of
bone, &ldquo;as big as a musket ball,&rdquo; was developed on the wings of
the males, and they used it as a weapon of offence while they
whirled themselves about twenty or thirty times in four or five
minutes, making a noise with their pinions like a rattle. The
mien was fierce and the walk stately, the birds living singly or
in pairs. The nest was a heap of palm leaves a foot high, and
contained a single large egg which was incubated by both parents.
The food consisted of seeds and leaves, and the birds aided
digestion by swallowing large stones; these were used by the
Dutch sailors to sharpen their knives with. One of these stones,
nearly an inch and a half in length, of extremely hard volcanic
rock, is in the Cambridge museum. The fighting knobs mentioned
above, are very interesting, large exostoses on one of the wrist-bones
of either wing; they were undoubtedly covered with a
thick, callous skin. Thousands of bones of this curious flightless
pigeon were collected through Sir E. Newton&rsquo;s<a name="fa9m" id="fa9m" href="#ft9m"><span class="sp">9</span></a> exertions, and
by H. H. Sclater on behalf of the Royal Society of London. The
results are several almost complete skeletons of both sexes,
composed however out of the enormous mass of the dissociated
bones.</p>

<p><a name="ft1m" id="ft1m" href="#fa1m"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The etymology of these names has been much discussed. That of
the latter, which has generally been adopted by German and French
authorities, seems to defy investigation, but the former has been
shown by Prof. Schlegel (<i>Versl. en Mededeel. K. Akad. Wetensch.</i>
ii. pp. 255 et seq.) to be the homely name of the dabchick or little
grebe (<i>Podiceps minor</i>), of which the Dutchmen were reminded by
the round stern and tail diminished to a tuft that characterized
the dodo. The same learned authority suggests that dodo is a
corruption of <i>Dodaars</i>, but, as will presently be seen, we herein think
him mistaken.</p>

<p><a name="ft2m" id="ft2m" href="#fa2m"><span class="fn">2</span></a> What has become of the specimen (which may have been a relic

and if, as is most likely, some of their nation, or men acquainted
with their language, were employed to pilot the Hollanders, we see
at once how the first Dutch name <i>WalghvÃ¶gel</i> would give way. The
meaning of <i>Doudo</i> not being plain to the Dutch, they would, as is
the habit of sailors, convert it into something they did understand.
Then <i>Dodaers</i> would easily suggest itself.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DODONA<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span>, in Epirus, the seat of the most ancient and venerable
of all Hellenic sanctuaries. Its ruins are at Dramisos, near
Tsacharovista. In later times the Greeks of the south looked on
the inhabitants of Epirus as barbarians; nevertheless for Dodona
they always preserved a certain reverence, and the temple there
was the object of frequent missions from them. This temple was
dedicated to Zeus, and connected with the temple was an oracle
which enjoyed more reputation in Greece than any other save
that at Delphi, and which would seem to date from earlier times
than the worship of Zeus; for the normal method of gathering
the responses of the oracle was by listening to the rustling of
an old oak tree, which was supposed to be the seat of the deity.
We seem here to have a remnant of the very ancient and widely
diffused tree-worship. Sometimes, however, auguries were taken
in other manners, being drawn from the moaning of doves in the
branches, the murmur of a fountain which rose close by, or the
resounding of the wind in the brazen caldrons which formed
a circle all round the temple. Croesus proposed to the oracle
his well-known question; Lysander sought to obtain from it a
sanction for his ambitious views; the Athenians frequently
appealed to its authority during the Peloponnesian War. But
the most frequent votaries were the neighbouring tribes of the
Acarnanians and Aetolians, together with the Boeotians, who
claimed a special connexion with the district.</p>

<p>Dodona is not unfrequently mentioned by ancient writers. It is
spoken of in the <i>Iliad</i> as the stormy abode of Selli who sleep on the
ground and wash not their feet, and in the <i>Odyssey</i> an imaginary
visit of Odysseus to the oracle is referred to. A Hesiodic fragment
gives a complete description of the Dodonaea or Hellopia, which
is called a district full of corn-fields, of herds and flocks and
of shepherds, where is built on an extremity (<span class="grk" title="ep eschatiÃª">&#7952;&#960;&#8125; &#7952;&#963;&#967;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#8131;</span>)
Dodona, where Zeus dwells in the stem of an oak (<span class="grk" title="phÃªgos">&#966;&#951;&#947;&#972;&#962;</span>). The
priestesses were called doves (<span class="grk" title="peleiai">&#960;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#953;</span>) and Herodotus tells a
story which he learned at Egyptian Thebes, that the oracle of
Dodona was founded by an Egyptian priestess who was carried
away by the Phoenicians, but says that the local legend substitutes
for this priestess a black dove, a substitution in which
he tries to find a rational meaning. From inscriptions and later
writers we learn that in historical times there was worshipped,
together with Zeus, a consort named Dione (see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Zeus</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oracle</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dione</a></span>).</p>

<p>The ruins, consisting of a theatre, the walls of a town, and some
other buildings, had been conjectured to be those of Dodona by
Wordsworth in 1832, but the conjecture was changed into
ascertained fact by the excavations of Constantin Carapanos. In
1875 he made some preliminary investigations; soon after, an
extensive discovery of antiquities was made by peasants, digging
without authority; and after this M. Carapanos made a systematic
excavation of the whole site to a considerable depth. The
topographical and architectural results are disappointing, and
show either that the site always retained its primitive simplicity,
or else that whatever buildings once existed have been very
completely destroyed.</p>

<p>To the south of the hill, on which are the walls of the town, and
to the east of the theatre, is a plateau about 200 yds. long and 50
yds. wide. Towards the eastern end of this terrace are the scanty
remains of a building which can hardly be anything but the
temple of Zeus; it appears to have consisted of pronaos, naos
or cella, and opisthodomus, and some of the lower drums of the
internal columns of the cella were still resting on their foundations.
No trace of any external colonnade was found. The
temple was about 130 ft. by 80 ft. It had been converted into a
Christian church, and hardly anything of its architecture seems to
have survived. In it and around it were found the most interesting
products of excavation&mdash;statuettes and decorative bronzes,
many of them bearing dedications to Zeus NaÃ¯us and Dione, and
inscriptions, including many small tablets of lead which contained
the questions put to the oracle. Farther to the west, on the same
terrace, were two rectangular buildings, which M. Carapanos
conjectures to have been connected with the oracle, but which
show no distinguishing features.</p>

<p>Below the terrace was a precinct, surrounded by walls and
flanked with porticoes and other buildings; it is over 100 yds. in
length and breadth, and of irregular shape. One of the buildings
on the south-western side contained a pedestal or altar, and is
identified by M. Carapanos as a temple of Aphrodite, on the
insufficient evidence of a single dedicated object; it does not
seem to have any of the characteristics of a temple. In front of
the porticoes are rows of pedestals, which once bore statues and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>
other dedications. At the southern corner of the precinct is a
kind of gate or propylaeum, flanked with two towers, between
which are placed two coarse limestone drums. If these are <i>in situ</i>
and belong to the original gateway, it must have been of a very
rough character; it does not seem probable that they carried,
as M. Carapanos suggests, the statuette and bronze bowl by
which divinations were carried on.</p>

<p>The chief interest of the excavation centres in the smaller
antiquities discovered, which have now been transferred from
M. Carapanos&rsquo;s collection to the National Museum in Athens.
Among the dedications, the most interesting historically are a
set of weapons dedicated by King Pyrrhus from the spoils of
the Romans, including characteristic specimens of the pilum.
The leaden tablets of the oracle contain no certain example of a
response, though there are many questions, varying from matters
of public policy or private enterprise to inquiries after stolen
goods.</p>

<p>The temple of Dodona was destroyed by the Aetolians in 219
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>, but the oracle survived to the times of Pausanias and even of
the emperor Julian.</p>

scholar, was born at Belford, Northumberland, the youngest son
of Rev. Marcus Dods, minister of the Scottish church of that town.
He was trained at Edinburgh Academy and Edinburgh University,
graduating in 1854. Having studied theology for five years
he was licensed in 1858, and in 1864 became minister of Renfield
Free Church, Glasgow, where he worked for twenty-five years. In
1889 he was appointed professor of New Testament Exegesis in
the New College, Edinburgh, of which he became principal on the
death of Dr Rainy in 1907. He died in Edinburgh on the 26th of
April 1909. Throughout his life, both ministerial and professorial,
he devoted much time to the publication of theological books.
Several of his writings, especially a sermon on Inspiration
delivered in 1878, incurred the charge of unorthodoxy, and
shortly before his election to the Edinburgh professorship he
was summoned before the General Assembly, but the charge was
dropped by a large majority, and in 1891 he received the honorary
degree of D.D. from Edinburgh University. He edited Lange&rsquo;s
<i>Life of Christ</i> in English (Edinburgh, 1864, 6 vols.), Augustine&rsquo;s
works (1872-1876), and, with Dr Alexander Whyte, Clark&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Handbooks for Bible Classes&rdquo; series. In the Expositor&rsquo;s
Bible series he edited Genesis and 1 Corinthians, and he was also a
contributor to the 9th edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>
and Hastings&rsquo; <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>. Among other important
works are: <i>The Epistle to the Seven Churches</i> (1865); <i>Israel&rsquo;s Iron
Age</i> (1874); <i>Mohammed, Buddha and Christ</i> (1877); <i>Handbook
on Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi</i> (1879); <i>The Gospel according
to St John</i> (1897), in the Expositor&rsquo;s Greek Testament; <i>The
Bible, its Origin and Nature</i> (1904), the Bross Lectures, in which
he gave an able sketch of the use of Old Testament criticism, and
finally set forth his Theory of Inspiration. Apart from his great
services to Biblical scholarship he takes high rank among those
who have sought to bring the results of technical criticism within
the reach of the ordinary reader.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DODSLEY, ROBERT<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> (1703-1764), English bookseller and
miscellaneous writer, was born in 1703 near Mansfield,
Nottinghamshire, where his father was master of the free school.
He is said to have been apprenticed to a stocking-weaver in
Mansfield, from whom he ran away, taking service as a footman.
In 1729 Dodsley published his first work, <i>Servitude; a Poem ...
written by a Footman</i>, with a preface and postscript ascribed to
Daniel Defoe; and a collection of short poems, <i>A Muse in Livery,
or the Footman&rsquo;s Miscellany</i>, was published by subscription in
1732, Dodsley&rsquo;s patrons comprising many persons of high rank.
This was followed by a satirical farce called <i>The Toyshop</i> (Covent
Garden, 1735), in which the toyman indulges in moral observations
on his wares, a hint which was probably taken from Thomas
Randolph&rsquo;s <i>Conceited Pedlar</i>. The profits accruing from the sale
of his works enabled Dodsley to establish himself with the help of
his friends&mdash;Pope lent him Â£100&mdash;as a bookseller at the &ldquo;Tully&rsquo;s
Head&rdquo; in Pall Mall in 1735. His enterprise soon made him one
of the foremost publishers of the day. One of his first publications
was Dr Johnson&rsquo;s <i>London</i>, for which he gave ten guineas in
1738. He published many of Johnson&rsquo;s works, and he suggested
and helped to finance the <i>English Dictionary</i>. Pope also made
over to Dodsley his interest in his letters. In 1738 the publication
of Paul Whitehead&rsquo;s <i>Manners</i>, voted scandalous by the Lords,
led to a short imprisonment. Dodsley published for Edward
Young and Mark Akenside, and in 1751 brought out Thomas
Gray&rsquo;s <i>Elegy</i>. He also founded several literary periodicals: <i>The
Museum</i> (1746-1767, 3 vols.); <i>The Preceptor containing a general
course of education</i> (1748, 2 vols.), with an introduction by Dr
Johnson; <i>The World</i> (1753-1756, 4 vols.); and <i>The Annual
Register</i>, founded in 1758 with Edmund Burke as editor. To
these various works, Horace Walpole, Akenside, Soame Jenyns,
Lord Lyttelton, Lord Chesterfield, Burke and others were
contributors. Dodsley is, however, best known as the editor of
two collections: <i>Select Collection of Old Plays</i> (12 vols., 1744;
2nd edition with notes by Isaac Reed, 12 vols., 1780; 4th edition,
by W. C. Hazlitt, 1874-1876, 15 vols.); and <i>A collection of Poems
by Several Hands</i> (1748, 3 vols.), which passed through many
editions. In 1737 his <i>King and the Miller of Mansfield</i>, a
&ldquo;dramatic tale&rdquo; of King Henry II., was produced at Drury
Lane, and received with much applause; the sequel, <i>Sir John
Cockle at Court</i>, a farce, appeared in 1738. In 1745 he published a
collection of his dramatic works, and some poems which had been
issued separately, in one volume under the modest title of <i>Trifles</i>.
This was followed by <i>The Triumph of Peace, a Masque occasioned
by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</i> (1749); a fragment, entitled
<i>Agriculture</i>, of a long tedious poem in blank verse on <i>Public
Virtue</i> (1753); <i>The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i> (acted at
Drury Lane 1739, printed 1741); and an ode, <i>Melpomene</i> (1757).
His tragedy of <i>Cleone</i> (1758) had a long run at Covent Garden,
2000 copies being sold on the day of publication, and it passed
through four editions within the year. Lord Chesterfield is,
however, almost certainly the author of the series of mock
chronicles of which <i>The Chronicle of the Kings of England</i> by
&ldquo;Nathan ben Saddi&rdquo; (1740) is the first, although they were
included in the <i>Trifles</i> and &ldquo;ben Saddi&rdquo; was received as Dodsley&rsquo;s
pseudonym. <i>The Economy of Human Life</i> (1750), a collection of
moral precepts frequently reprinted, is also by Lord Chesterfield.
In 1759 Dodsley retired, leaving the conduct of the business to his
brother James (1724-1797), with whom he had been many years
in partnership. He published two more works, <i>The Select Fables
of Aesop translated by R. D.</i> (1764) and the <i>Works of William
Shenstone</i> (3 vols., 1764-1769). He died at Durham while on
a visit to his friend the Rev. Joseph Spence, on the 23rd of
September 1764.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DODSWORTH, ROGER<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> (1585-1654), English antiquary, was
born near Oswaldkirk, Yorkshire. He devoted himself early to
antiquarian research, in which he was greatly assisted by the
fact that his father, Matthew Dodsworth, was registrar of York
cathedral, and could give him access to the records preserved
there. He married the widow of Laurence Rawsthorne of Hutton
Grange, where he subsequently resided till his death in August
1654. At various times in his life he was enabled to study the
records in the library of Sir Robert Cotton, in Skipton Castle,
and in the Tower of London. He collected a vast store of
materials for a history of Yorkshire, a <i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i>,
and an English baronage. The second of these was published
with considerable additions by Sir William Dugdale (2 vols.,
1655 and 1661). The MSS. were left to Thomas, third Lord
Fairfax, who by his will bequeathed them (160 volumes in all) to
the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Portions have been printed
by the Yorkshire Archaeological Society (<i>Dodsworth&rsquo;s Yorkshire
Notes</i>, 1884) and the Chetham Society (copies of Lancashire postmortem
inquisitions, 1875-1876).</p>
